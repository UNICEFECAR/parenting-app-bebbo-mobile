    * TypeScript was used as a programming language
    * Same source code compiles to both iOS and Android applications
* [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * NPM (Node Package Manager) was used to install third party packages and to run various scripts necessary during development.
<!--* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Both Mac and Windows can be used for development.
* Follow [these instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) in order to prepare machine for development, specifically “React Native CLI Quickstart”.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
```
2. Install NPM packages (DONT USE yarn!)
```sh
npm install
```
3. Only on Mac, go to "ios" folder, and run
```sh
pod install
```
<!-- 4. Create  "src/app/apiConfig.ts"
    - Server part of "Parent Buddy" is Drupal application
    - Administrator of Drupal application should give you values that you should put in apiConfig.ts
    - apiConfig.ts should look like this
```
export const apiConfig = {
    apiUsername: '...',
    apiPassword: '...',
    apiAuthUsername: '...',
    apiAuthPassword: '...',
};
```-->
4. Configure Firebase services
    - [Create Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
    - Add iOS and Android apps to Firebase project the standard way
    - Use Firebase wizards to create these:
        - google-services.json
        - GoogleService-Info.plist
    - Copy files here:
        -  android/app/google-services.json
        - ios/GoogleService-Info.plist

5. configure google Signin and GDrive Import/Export
    - Enable Google Drive API from Cloud Console.
    - Choose Scope For Drive Access
    - Copy Access key from GoogleInfo.plist and add in ios/info.plist as
        <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
        <array>
        <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
        <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.{{firebase_project_number}}-{{client_id_key}}/string>
        </array>
        </dict>
        </array>        


<!-- RUNNING -->
## Running

```
npm run android
npm run android-release
npm run ios
npm run ios-device
npm run ios-device-release
