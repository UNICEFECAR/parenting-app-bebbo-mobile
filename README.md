4. For iOS, copy fontello.ttf file from https://github.com/UNICEFECAR/parenting-app-bebbo-mobile/blob/main/app/assets/fonts/fontello.ttf to node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts  
Refer this library for custom fonts: https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons.

5. For Android, add keystore files into \android\app folder to generate Android build.
      To add a keystore file to your Android project’s `android/app` folder and configure it for signing, Follow the following steps to add keystore file.:

    5.1. *Obtain or create a keystore file*
    
    If you don’t already have a keystore file, you need to generate one. You can use the `keytool` command to create it:
    
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the following command to generate a new keystore file:
    
      ```bash
      keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias my-key-alias
      ```
    
    - Follow the prompts to enter details such as passwords, organizational information, etc.

    5.2. *Add a keystore file to the project*
    
    - *Navigate to Your Project Directory:*
      - Open your project in your file explorer or terminal.
      - Go to the `android/app` directory of your project.
    
    - *Copy the Keystore File:*
      - Move or copy your `my-release-key.jks` file into the `android/app` directory.

    5.3. *Configure Gradle for Signing*
    
    - *Open the `build.gradle` File:*
      - In your project, navigate to `android/app/build.gradle`.
    
    - *Add Signing Configuration:*
      - Modify the `build.gradle` file to include signing configuration. Add the following code inside the `android` block:
    
        ```groovy
        android {
            ...
            signingConfigs {
                release {
                    if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
                        storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
                        storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
                        keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
                        keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
                    }
                }
            }
            buildTypes {
                release {
                    signingConfig signingConfigs.release
                    // Optional: Enable ProGuard to shrink and obfuscate code
                    minifyEnabled false
                    proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
                }
            }
        }
        ```

- **Add Signing Properties:**
  - Create or update the `gradle.properties` file located in the `android/` directory of your project (if the file doesn’t exist, create it).

  - Add the following properties to `gradle.properties`:

    ```properties
    MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.jks
    MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
    MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your-store-password
    MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your-key-password
    ```

    Replace `your-store-password` and `your-key-password` with the actual passwords you used when creating the keystore.

6. Configure Firebase services

## Steps to Generate Required Keys and Tokens

### 1. Create Facebook App ID and Client Token

#### Create a Facebook Developer Account
- Visit [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/).
- Log in with your Facebook account or create a new account.

#### Create a New App
- Navigate to "My Apps" and click "Create App."
- Select the appropriate app type, such as "Consumer."
- Enter the app name as "Bebbo" and follow the instructions to complete the setup.

#### Obtain the Facebook App ID
- Once the app is created, the **App ID** will be visible on your app dashboard. This is your `facebookAppId`.

#### Generate a Client Token
- Go to "Settings" > "Basic" in your app dashboard.
- Scroll down to find the "Client Token" section. Click "Show" to view and copy your `facebookClientToken`.

### 2. Generate Google Client ID

#### Create a Google Developer Account
- Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Sign in with your Google account.

#### Create a New Project
- In the Google Cloud Console, click "Select a Project" > "New Project."
- Name your project (e.g., "Bebbo Production") and click "Create."

#### Enable Google Sign-In API
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library."
- Search for "Google Sign-In API" and enable it for your project.

#### Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."
- Click "Create Credentials" and choose "OAuth 2.0 Client ID."
- Configure the consent screen and then generate your `clientIdKey`.

### 3. Generate AES-256 Encryption Key and IV Key

#### Generate Encryption Key
You can use various tools or libraries to generate a 256-bit encryption key. Here’s how to do it using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
- The output will be a 64-character hexadecimal string. This is your `encryptionsKey`.

#### Generate Initialization Vector (IV)
Similarly, generate a 128-bit IV:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 16
```
- The output will be a 32-character hexadecimal string. This is your `encryptionsIVKey`.
