This activity will help your little one to get started with this skill, which with practice they will master in no time. To start, you only need to lay your little one on her back on a soft surface, like your bed. Take one of her legs and cross it in front of the other. Do it again with the other leg. Repeat about three times and on the fourth time, take the leg, cross it in front of the other, put your other hand under her back and help her roll over until she is on her tummy. You can recite the following rhyme while doing the exercises:</p><p><em>     Round and round and you'll change!</em></p><p><em>     What you can see?</em></p><p><em>     Round, round, you will give,</em></p><p><em>     You alone will see!</em></p><p>Remember that all movements must be delicate and that your little one must already have enough strength in her neck to avoid hurting her. Lie her on her back and repeat for the other side. Finish the exercise with lots of kisses. Now talk to your little one to get his or her attention. When you do it, you can repeat the rhyme.</p><p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Help your little one begin to have the strength and coordinated movements to turn from back to tummy, which will allow her to start to have the necessary coordination to move in a few months.</p>",

Stay quiet for a bit and encourage your child to do the same. Say something like \"shhhhh, let's hear what sound we can catch\" and then point to your ears. You may hear pounding, whining, creaking, rattling, scratching, chattering. Encourage the child “Let’s see if we can collect the sounds we can hear. I can hear the clock ticking, the bus passing, the neighbor arriving by elevator.” Use lots of interesting words like that - even if your child doesn't understand them yet.  </p><p>If the child is older, you can also ask the question \"Where could I find this sound?\" (And then imitate it). Let him enjoy the feeling of discovery and making the connection between the sound and the object that makes it, by naming it. In that way, the language will connect with the concepts and enrich the vocabulary as well. </p><p>You can use this activity in practically every life situation - during free play and free time, but also during daily routines - dressing, preparing meals, hygiene routine, shopping,  walking, driving, and (if local health requirements permit) waiting for the bus or for your turn at the bank, post office, or at the doctor.</p><p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is looking forward to activities with you and as you play together he imitates facial expressions, gestures, and some activities of close people, points with her index finger to what interests him, or offers things to other people in order to interest them and involve them in the game. This activity builds his vocabulary and knowledge of the world. Let your child explore the surroundings and tell you what he hears, even with babbling or simple words.</p>",

Все это расширяет его словарный запас и помогает исследовать окружающий мир. Давайте малышу возможность изучать все вокруг и рассказывать вам, что он слышит, даже если его речь пока — это лепет или самые простые слова.</p>",

E tëra çfarë ju duhet të bëni është të filloni zakonin e ndalimit dhe dëgjimit mirë në mënyrë që të kapni të gjithë tingujt në dhomë ose përreth jush. Qëndroni të qetë për pak kohë dhe inkurajoni fëmijën tuaj të bëjë të njëjtën gjë. Thoni diçka si \"shhhhh, le të dëgjojmë se çfarë tingulli mund të kapim\" dhe pastaj bëni me gisht në drejtim të veshëve tuaj. Ju mund të dëgjoni rrahje, rënkime, kërcitje, zhurma, gërvishtje, llafe. Inkurajoni fëmijën “Le të shohim nëse mund të mbledhim tinguj që mund të dëgjojmë. Unë mund të dëgjoj orën që tingëllon, autobusin duke kaluar, fqinjin që mbërrin me ashensor.” Përdorni shumë fjalë interesante si ato - edhe nëse fëmija juaj nuk i kupton ato ende.</p><p>Nëse fëmija është më i madh, mund të bëni edhe pyetjen \"Ku mund ta gjej këtë tingull?\" (Dhe pastaj imitojeni atë). Le të gëzojë ndjenjën e zbulimit dhe krijimin e lidhjes midis zërit dhe objektit që e bën atë, duke e emëruar atë. Në atë mënyrë, gjuha do të lidhet me konceptet dhe do të pasurojë fjalorin gjithashtu.</p><p>Ju mund ta përdorni këtë aktivitet praktikisht në çdo situatë të jetës - gjatë lojës së lirë dhe kohës së lirë, por edhe gjatë rutinës së përditshme - veshja, përgatitja e vakteve, rutina e higjienës, pazari, ecja, vozitja dhe (nëse lejojnë kërkesat lokale të shëndetit) pritja e autobusit ose radhës tuaj në bankë, zyrë postare ose te mjeku.</p><p><strong>Çfarë po mëson fëmija juaj:  </strong>Fëmija juaj pret me padurim aktivitete me ju dhe ndërsa luani së bashku ajo imiton shprehjet e fytyrës, gjestet dhe disa aktivitete të njerëzve të afërt, drejton gishtin e saj tregues për atyre që i interesojnë asaj/atij ose u ofron gjëra njerëzve të tjerë në mënyrë që u intereson atyre dhe i përfshijnë ata në lojë. Ky aktivitet ndërton fjalorin dhe njohuritë e tij/saj për botën. Lëreni fëmijën tuaj të eksplorojë gjërat që e rrethojnë dhe t'ju tregojë se çfarë dëgjon ai/ajo, madje edhe me dërdëllitje ose fjalë të thjeshta.</p>",

Па-першае, яно даведваецца, што ў любой трывожнай сітуацыі вы заўсёды яго супакоіце і дасце яму пачуццё абароненасці (эмацыйная бяспека). Па-другое, ваша дзіця ўсведамляе, што іншыя людзі часта аказваюцца прыемнымі ў зносінах і з імі можа быць весела (сацыяльнае развіццё). Як заўсёды, вялікае значэнне мае ваша падтрымка.</p>",

Можаце апісваць тое, што бачыце на малюнку, або расказваць пра гэта гісторыю, паказваць пальцам на малюнкі і прагаворваць усё, што на іх выяўлена. Выкарыстоўвайце кароткія і простыя сказы. Мяняйце інтанацыю, рабіце паўзы. Ваш голас павінен перадаваць розныя эмоцыі — здзіўленне, радасць...</p><p>Важна, каб дзіця бачыла выраз вашага твару, а вы назіралі за яго мімікай. Прагаворвайце тыя эмоцыі і рэакцыі, якія бачыце, называйце тое, што дзіцяці падабаецца і не падабаецца. Няхай яно дакранаецца да кнігі, перагортвае старонкі і наогул вывучае яе ўсімі магчымымі спосабамі. Калі дзіця пачынае ўтвараць гукі, разглядаючы малюнкі, то няхай «чытае» разам з вамі — слухайце дзіця і адказвайце, паўтараючы за ім гукі, задаючы пытанні і падбадзёрваючы. Калі вы бачыце, што дзіця больш не займае кніга (яно глядзіць у бок ці неяк інакш дэманструе нежаданне працягваць), проста цярпліва чакайце, пакуль яно зноў не зверне ўвагу на яе, і тады працягвайце. Калі кніга дзіця больш не цікавіць, займіцеся чым-небудзь іншым і вярніцеся да яе пазней.</p><p>Чаму пры гэтым вучыцца дзіця. Сумеснае чытанне і разглядванне кніг важна для развіцця камунікатыўных навыкаў і моўнага развіцця вашага дзіцяці.</p>",

Позволете му да пипа книжката, да я слага в устата си (ако е безопасно) и да я изследва по други начини. Ако бебето издава звуци, докато четете, позволете му и то да „чете“. Изслушайте го и отговорете, като повтаряте звуците му, задавате въпроси и го хвалите. Когато забележите, че на бебето вече не му е интересно – отмества поглед или протестира по някакъв друг начин – търпеливо изчакайте вниманието му да се върне към книжката и продължете. Ако книжката повече не му е интересна, върнете се към нея по-късно.</p><p><strong>Какво научава детето ви: </strong>Четенето и разглеждането на книжки заедно е важно за комуникативните умения на вашето бебе и за развитието на езика.</p>",

Това, което трябва да направите, е да си създадете навик да се спирате и да се заслушвате внимателно, за да уловите всички звуци наоколо (в стаята или навън). Запазете тишина за малко и насърчете детето си да направи същото. Кажете нещо като „шшшт, нека чуем какъв звук можем да чуем“ и след това посочете ушите си. Може да чуете удряне, скимтене, скърцане, тропане, драскане, бърборене. Насърчете детето „Да видим дали можем да назовем звуците, които можем да чуем. Чувам как часовникът тиктака, как минава автобусът, как съседът пристига с асансьора.“ Използвайте множество интересни думи като тези – дори ако детето ви все още не ги разбира.</p><p>Ако детето е по-голямо, можете също да го попитате „Къде мога да открия този звук?“ (И след това имитирайте звука). Нека то се наслади на усещането за откритие и на това, че може да направи връзка между звука и обекта, който го произвежда, като го назове. По този начин езикът се свързва с понятията, а също така се обогатява речникът му.</p><p>Можете да използвате това занимание практически във всяка житейска ситуация – по време на свободна игра и свободното време, но също така и по време на обичайните дейности през деня – обличане, приготвяне на храната, поддържане на хигиената, пазаруване, разходки, шофиране и (ако изискванията на здравните власти го позволяват) чакане на автобуса или на реда си в банката, пощата или при лекаря.</p><p><strong>Какво научава детето ви: </strong>Вашето дете с нетърпение очаква дейностите с вас и докато играете заедно, то имитира израженията на лицето, жестовете и някои дейности на близките хора, посочва с показалец това, което го интересува, или предлага неща на други хора, за да ги заинтригува и да ги включи в играта. Тази дейност изгражда неговия речник и познанията за света. Позволете на детето си да изследва заобикалящата го среда и да ви казва какво чува, дори с бърборене или прости думи.</p>",

Като научи още повече, може да помолите детето си просто да намери предмети с определен цвят, без да предлагате еталон, с който да ги сравнява – или да го попитате какъв цвят иска да търси.</p><p>Освен тази игра, помагайте на детето си да научи цветовете като просто използвате техните имена в ежедневните разговори (готвене: „Сега ще обеля тези жълти банани“ или обличане: „Хайде да намерим виолетовата ти риза, за да я облечеш днес.\")</p><p><strong>Какво научава вашето дете: </strong>Познаването на цветовете е важна част от готовността за училище. Мисленето на вашето дете се развива, когато то разбере концепцията, че предметите могат да изглеждат различни, но да имат един и същ цвят – и че сходни предмети, като шапките например, може да са с различни цветове.</p>",

Αυτή η δραστηριότητα εμπλουτίζει το λεξιλόγιό και τη γνώση του για τον κόσμο.

Taci puțin și încurajează-ți copilul să facă același lucru. Spune ceva de genul „șșșșșș, să auzim ce sunet putem prinde” și apoi arată către urechi.

Astfel, limbajul se va conecta cu conceptele și va îmbogăți și vocabularul. </p><p>Poți să folosești această activitate în aproape orice situație de viață - în timpul jocului liber și al timpului liber, dar și în timpul rutinei zilnice - îmbrăcatul, preparatul meselor, rutina igienei, cumpărături, mers pe jos, condus și (dacă cerințele locale de sănătate permit acest lucru) așteptatul autobuzului sau statul la coadă tău la bancă, la oficiul poștal, sau la medic.</p><p><strong>Ce învață copilul: </strong>Copilul așteaptă cu nerăbdare să facă activități cu tine și, în timp ce vă jucați împreună, imită expresii faciale, gesturi, și unele activități ale persoanelor apropiate, arată cu degetul arătător către ceea ce îl interesează, sau oferă lucruri altor persoane pentru a le stârni interesul și a-i implica în joc. Această activitate îi îmbunătățește vocabularul și cunoașterea lumii. Lasă-l pe copil să exploreze împrejurimile și să-ți spună ce aude, chiar și prin bâlbâieli sau cuvinte simple.</p>",

Evo, ja čujem sat kako otkucava, autobus prolazi, komšija dolazi liftom.“ Koristite što više zanimljivih riječi, čak i ako znate da ih Vaše dijete još ne razumije.</p><p>Ako je dijete starije, možete postaviti i pitanje: „Gdje mogu da pronađem ovaj zvuk?“ (nakon čega ćete oponašati traženi zvuk). Neka dijete uživa u otkrivanju zvukova i uspostavljanju veze između zvuka i predmeta koji ga proizvodi tako što ćete ga imenovati. Na taj način jezik se povezuje s pojmovima, a rječnik se obogaćuje.</p><p>Ovu aktivnost možete praktikovati gotovo u svakoj životnoj situaciji – u igri i tokom slobodnog vremena, ali i tokom svakodnevnih aktivnosti - oblačenja, pripreme obroka, rutinskog održavanja higijene, kupovine, šetnje, vožnje - a ako lokalni zdravstveni propisi to dozvoljavaju, i dok čekate autobus ili svoj red u banci, pošti ili kod ljekara.</p><p><strong>Što dijete uči: </strong>Vaše dijete uživa u zajedničkim aktivnostima s Vama. Dok se igrate, ono će imitirati izraze lica, gestove i druge oblike ponašanja bliskih ljudi, upirući prstom u ono što ga interesuje ili nudeći stvari drugim ljudima kako bi ih zainteresovalo i uključilo u igru. Opisana aktivnost izgrađuje vokabular djeteta i njegovo znanje o svijetu. Omogućite djetetu da istraži svoje okruženje i saopšti Vam što čuje, čak i ako samo brblja ili koristi najjednostavnije riječi.</p>",

Prvo, da ste Vi ta osoba koja će ga podržati i utješiti u svim stresnim situacijama (emocionalna sigurnost). Drugo, da su drugi ljudi često fini i da mogu biti zabavni kao društvo (socijalni razvoj). Kao i uvijek, Vaša podrška je od presudnog značaja. </p>",

Vježbu ispratite nekom brojalicom, npr.: <em>Jedan, dva i tri, na stomačiću si sada ti!</em></p><p>Imajte na umu: svi pokreti moraju biti delikatni, a bebin vrat mora biti već dovoljno snažan da se ne bi povrijedio tokom vježbe.

Vježbu završite s puno poljubaca i uzvika BRAVO! Razgovarajte malo sa svojom bebom kako biste joj zadržali pažnju, a onda ponovite vježbu prateći je brojalicama i rimama.</p><p><strong>Što dijete uči: </strong>Vaša beba<strong> </strong>stiče snagu mišića koja joj je potrebna da se prevrne s leđa na stomak i obratno.

За почеток, треба само да го поставите на грб на мека површина, како на ппример кревет. Земете му ја едната нога и прекрстете ја пред другата. Направете го тоа повторно со другата нога. Повторете околу три пати и по четврти пат, земете му ја ногата, прекрстете ја пред другата, ставете ја другата рака под неговиот грб и помогнете му да се преврти додека не биде на стомак. Можете да му пеете некоја песничка додека ги правите вежбите.</p><p>Запомнете дека сите движења мора да бидат нежни и дека бебето треба самото да ја држи главата за да се избегне повреда. Легнете го назад на грб и повторете ја вежбата на другата страна. Завршете ја вежбата со многу бакнежи. Потоа зборувајте му за да го привлечете неговото внимание. Повторно може да му испеете некоја песничка.</p><p><strong>Што учи вашето дете: </strong>Помогнете му на вашето малечко да започне да добива сила и координирани движења да се преврти од грб на стомак, што ќе му овозможи да започне да ја стекнува потребната координација за движење за неколку месеци.</p>",

Taci puțin și încurajează-ți copilul să facă același lucru. Spune ceva de genul „șșșșșș, să auzim ce sunet putem prinde” și apoi arată către urechi. S-ar putea să auziți sunete precum bătăi, scâncete, scârțâit, zăngănit, scrijelit, trăncănit. Încurajează-l pe copil „Să vedem dacă putem strânge sunetele pe care le auzim. Aud ceasul ticăind, autobuzul trecând, vecinul sosind cu liftul.” Foloseşte o mulţime de cuvinte interesante de genul ăsta - chiar dacă bebelușul nu le înţelege încă.  </p><p>În cazul în care copilul este mai mare, poți să pui și întrebarea „Unde aș putea găsi acest sunet?” (Și apoi imită sunetul). Lasă-l să se bucure de senzația de descoperire și să facă legătura dintre sunet și obiectul care produce sunetul, numindu-l. Astfel, limbajul se va conecta cu conceptele și va îmbogăți și vocabularul. </p><p>Poți să folosești această activitate în aproape orice situație de viață - în timpul jocului liber și al timpului liber, dar și în timpul rutinei zilnice - îmbrăcatul, preparatul meselor, rutina igienei, cumpărături, mers pe jos, condus și (dacă cerințele locale de sănătate permit acest lucru) așteptatul autobuzului sau statul la coadă tău la bancă, la oficiul poștal, sau la medic.</p><p><strong>Ce învață copilul: </strong>Copilul așteaptă cu nerăbdare să facă activități cu tine și, în timp ce vă jucați împreună, imită expresii faciale, gesturi, și unele activități ale persoanelor apropiate, arată cu degetul arătător către ceea ce îl interesează, sau oferă lucruri altor persoane pentru a le stârni interesul și a-i implica în joc. Această activitate îi îmbunătățește vocabularul și cunoașterea lumii. Lasă-l pe copil să exploreze împrejurimile și să-ți spună ce aude, chiar și prin bâlbâieli sau cuvinte simple.</p>",

Această activitate îl va ajuta pe cel mic să înceapă cu această abilitate, pe care, prin practică, o va stăpâni în cel mai scurt timp. Pentru început, trebuie doar să-l așezi pe micuț pe spate pe o suprafață moale, cum ar fi patul tău. Ia-i unul dintre picioare și pune-l încrucișat în fața celuilalt. Fă acest lucru din nou cu celălalt picior. Repetă de aproximativ trei ori și a patra oară, ia piciorul, pune-l încrucișat în fața celuilalt, pune-ți cealaltă mână sub spatele lui și ajutați-l să se rostogolească până când ajunge pe burtă. Puteți recita următoarea poezioară în timp ce faceți exercițiile:</p><p><em>     Rotește-te rotește-te și te vei schimba!</em></p><p><em>     Ce poţi vedea?</em></p><p><em>     Rotește-te rotește-te, vei da,</em></p><p><em>     Numai tu vei vedea!</em></p><p>Nu uita că toate mișcările trebuie să fie delicate și că cel mic trebuie să aibă deja suficientă forță în gât pentru a nu se răni. Pune-l pe spate și repetă pentru cealaltă parte. Termină exercițiul cu multe sărutări. Acum vorbeşte cu micuţul tău ca să-i atragi atenţia. Când faci acest lucru, poți să repeți poezioara.</p><p><strong>Ce învață copilul: </strong>Ajută-l pe cel mic să înceapă să aibă forța și mișcările coordonate pentru a se întoarce de pe spate pe burtă, ceea ce îi va permite să înceapă să aibă coordonarea necesară pentru a se deplasa peste câteva luni.</p>",

Da biste „probili led“, u zavisnosti od situacije, možete novoj osobi da  date igračku ili neki drugi predmet koji će probuditi radoznalost deteta.</p><p><strong>Šta vaše dete uči: </strong>Pomenuta nelagoda u prisustvu novih ljudi može potrajati prilično dugo, ali vaše dete uči dve stvari kroz taj proces. Prvo, da ste vi ta osoba koja će je podržati i utešiti u stresnim situacijama (emocionalna sigurnost). Drugo, dete uči da su drugi ljudi često fini i da mogu biti zabavni kao društvo (socijalni razvoj). Kao i uvek, vaša podrška je veoma dobrodošla.</p>",

Sve što treba da uradite je da uspostavite naviku zastajkivanja i dobrog osluškivanja kako biste uhvatili sve zvukove u sobi ili oko sebe. Budite tihi za trenutak i podstaknite svoje dete da učini isto. Recite nešto poput „Šššššš, hajde da čujemo koji zvuk možemo uhvatiti“, a zatim pokažite na svoje uši. Možete čuti udaranje, cviljenje, škripanje, zveckanje, grebanje, čavrljanje. Ohrabrite dete „Hajde da nabrojimo sve zvuke koje čujemo. Čujem kako otkucava sat, autobus prolazi, komšija dolazi liftom.“ Koristite puno zanimljivih reči, čak i ako ih vaše dete još ne razume.</p><p>Ako je dete starije, pitajte: „Gde da pronađem ovaj zvuk?“ (onda oponašajte traženi zvuk). Neka dete uživa u otkrivanju i uspostavljanju veze između zvuka i predmeta koji ga proizvodi i neka ga imenuje. Na taj način jezik se povezuje s pojmovima a rečnik se bogati.</p><p>Ovu aktivnost možete praktikovati u skoro svakoj životnoj situaciji - tokom slobodne igre i slobodnog vremena, ali i tokom svakodnevnih rutina - oblačenja, pripreme obroka, rutinskog održavanja higijene, kupovine, šetnje, vožnje i (ako lokalni zdravstveni propisi to dozvoljavaju) čekanja na autobus, u redu u banci, pošti ili kod doktora.</p><p><strong>Šta vaše dete uči: </strong>Vaše dete raduje se aktivnostima s vama i dok se igrate imitiraće izraze lica, gestove i kretnje, upirući kažiprstom u ono što ga interesuje i nudeći stvari drugim ljudima kako bi ih zainteresovalo i uključilo u igru. Pomenuta aktivnost izgrađuje vokabular deteta i njegovo znanje o svetu. Omogućite svom detetu da istraži svoje okruženje i saopšti vam šta čuje, čak i ako samo brblja ili koristi jednostavne reči.</p>",

В этот момент можно указать пальцем на свои уши.

Малышу важно освоить навык переворачивания в кратчайшие сроки. Вы можете помочь ему научиться переворотам. Для этого всего лишь нужно уложить малыша на спину на мягкую поверхность, например на кровать. Затем возьмите одну ногу малыша и перекиньте через другую. Повторите то же самое с другой ногой. Повторите три раза, а на четвертый положите свою вторую руку под спину малыша и помогите ему перевернуться, аккуратно направляя его, пока он не окажется на животе. </p><p>Помните: чтобы не навредить малышу, необходимо выполнять все действия как можно аккуратнее, все движения должны быть мягкими, а еще ребенок уже должен самостоятельно держать голову.</p><p>Снова положите малыша на спину и повторите упражнение, переворачивая его уже в другую сторону. Разговаривайте с ребенком, чтобы его внимание было обращено на вас, проговаривайте, что вы делаете. </p><p><strong>Чему при этом учится ребенок. </strong>Благодаря таким занятиям<strong> </strong>малыш становится сильнее и учится выполнять согласованные действия для переворота со спины на животик, что в свою очередь помогает ему выработать необходимые навыки координации движений, которые понадобятся ему в дальнейшей двигательной активности через несколько месяцев.</p>",

Це заняття допоможе вашому малюкові розпочати роботу з цією навичкою, яку з практикою вони оволодіють миттєво. Для початку вам потрібно лише покласти дитину на спину на м’яку поверхню, як-от ваше ліжко. Візьміть одну з її ніг і схрестіть її перед іншою. Зробіть це ще раз іншою ногою. Повторіть приблизно три рази, а в четвертий раз візьміть ногу, схрестіть її перед іншою, іншу руку покладіть під її спину і допоможіть їй перевернутися, поки дитина не опиниться на животі. Виконуючи вправи, ви можете прочитати наступну риму:</p><p><em>     Кругом, і ти змінишся!</em></p><p><em>     Що ти можеш побачити?</em></p><p><em>     Кругом, кругом, отак,</em></p><p><em>     Ти все побачиш!</em></p><p>Пам’ятайте, що всі рухи повинні бути делікатними і що у вашої дитини вже має бути достатньо сили в шиї, щоб не поранити її. Покладіть її на спину і повторіть вправу для іншого боку. Завершіть вправу великою кількістю поцілунків. Тепер поговоріть зі своїм малюком, щоб привернути його чи її увагу. Коли ви це зробите, ви можете повторити риму.</p><p><strong>Чого навчається ваша дитина: </strong>допоможіть своїй дитині набратися сил і скоординованих рухів, щоб повертатися зі спинки на животик, що дозволить їй за кілька місяців мати необхідну координацію для руху.</p>",

Активная практика этого упражнения поможет малышу освоить навык переворачивания в кратчайшие сроки. Для начала вам нужно всего лишь уложить малыша на спину на мягкую поверхность, например на кровать. Возьмите одну ногу малыша и перекиньте через другую. Повторите то же самое с другой ногой. Повторите примерно три таких скрещивания, а в четвертый раз положите свою вторую руку под спину малыша и помогите ему/ей перевернуться, аккуратно направляя, пока он/она не окажется на животе.</p><p>Во время выполнения упражнений вы можете читать стишок:</p><p>Круг за кругом, и ты изменишь,</p><p>То,что ты увидишь.</p><p>Круг за кругом,  и ты передаешь</p><p>То, что ты увидишь!</p><p>Помните, чтобы избежать болезненных ощущений у малыша, все движения должны быть нежными, и он/она уже должен(на) самостоятельно держать голову.</p><p>Снова положите малыша на спину и повторите упражнение, переворачивая его\\её уже с другой стороны тела. Поговорите с малышом, чтобы привлечь  внимание с той стороны куда он/она перевернулся(лась), повторяя при этом четверостишие. Завершайте упражнение множеством поцелуев.</p><p>Чему учится ваш ребенок: Помогает малышу приобрести силу и скоординированность движений, чтобы переворачиваться со спины на животик, которая позволит ему/ей приобрести необходимые навыки координации для дальнейшей двигательной активности через несколько месяцев.</p>",

Dotknite sa najprv jeho chodidiel, ponúknite im oporu Vašimi dlaňami. Možno pocítite, ako Vám Vaše dieťa zatlačí nohami do dlaní, možno pri tejto hre zodvihne svoje nohy vyššie nad podložku. Jednu nohu mu jemne vezmite do dlaní a nasmerujte jej pohyb tak, aby prekrížila druhú nohu. Potom prestriedajte strany. Vaše dieťa bude prenášať váhu z jednej strany na druhú. Zopakujte to niekoľkokrát a potom skúste viesť tento pohyb tak, aby sa Vaše dieťa pretočilo až sa na bok. Pomôžte mu pritom druhou rukou, ktorú dajte pod panvu a jemne ju z jednej strany podvihnite. Po chvíľke oddychu mu môžte dotykom na panve a chrbátiku pomôcť pretočiť sa až na brucho. Počas cvičenia môžete recitovať nejakú básničku:</p><p><em>     Gúľalo sa gúľalo, to červené jabĺčko, </em></p><p><em>     Gúľalo sa gúľalo, k našim deťom ľahúčko. </em></p><p>Všetky pohyby robte veľmi plynulo a jemne, s cvičením začnite až vtedy, keď Vaše dieťa vie udržať pri pretáčaní hlavičku.</p><p>Pretáčanie zopakujte po oddychu aj na druhú stranu.</p><p><strong>Čo sa Vaše dieťa učí: </strong>Ukážte Vášmu dieťaťu cestu, akou sa môže pretočiť z chrbta na brucho. O niekoľko mesiacov, keď svoje pohyby skoordinuje, to zvládne aj samé.</p>",

Zostaňte chvíľu ticho a povzbudzujte svoje dieťa, aby urobilo to isté. Povedzte „ššššš, počuješ, čo to bol za zvuk?“ a potom ukážte na Vaše uši. Zvyčajne vieme zachytiť rôzne zvuky ako napríklad: búchanie, bzučanie hmyzu, kňučanie alebo štekanie psa, vŕzganie dverí, hrkanie, škriabanie po podlahe, húkanie sanitky, trúbenie auta, škrekot vtákov a podobne. Povzbudzujte dieťa aby po Vás zvuky napodobňovalo, môžete povedať: „Počujem, ako hodiny tikajú, počujem autobus, počujem výťah.“ Použite veľa zaujímavých slov, na pomenovanie zvukov aj keď im Vaše dieťa ešte nerozumie.  </p><p>Ak je dieťa staršie, môžete tiež položiť otázku „Kde by som mohol nájsť tento zvuk?\" (potom ho napodobnite). Nechajte ho vychutnať si pocit, že niečo uhádlo, lebo tak si vytvára spojenie medzi zvukom a objektom, ktorý ho vytvára a jeho názvom. Týmto spôsobom sa jazyk a slovná zásoba dieťaťa obohacuje.</p><p>Túto aktivitu môžete využiť prakticky v každej životnej situácii - počas voľného hrania a voľného času, ale aj pri každodenných rutinách - obliekaní, príprave jedál, hygiene, nakupovaní, chôdzi, šoférovaní a čakaní na autobus alebo pri státi v rade v banke, pošte alebo u lekára.</p><p><strong>Čo sa Vaše dieťa učí: </strong>Vaše dieťa sa teší na aktivity s Vami a pri spoločnom hraní napodobňuje výrazy tváre, gestá a niektoré aktivity blízkych ľudí, ukazovákom ukazuje na to, čo ho zaujíma, alebo ponúka veci iným ľuďom, aby ich zaujalo a zapojilo ich do hry. Táto činnosť buduje jeho slovnú zásobu a poznanie sveta. Nechajte svoje dieťa preskúmať okolie a povie Vám, čo počuje, dokonca aj džavotaním alebo jednoduchými slovami.</p>",

Počas čítania alebo rozprávania o obrázkoch povzbudzujte dieťa, aby otáčalo stránky. Urobte to zaujímavé a vzrušujúce: napríklad: \"Uvidíme, kam teraz pôjde mačka. Môžeš otočiť stránku?\" Ukážte dieťaťu ako má stránku otočiť a v prípade potreby veďte jeho ruku. Môžete povedať: \"Ďakujem, že si otočil/a stránku. Teraz vidíme, že mačka je na strome!\" Keď má Vaše dieťa o knihy záujem a dokáže otáčať stránky, zaraďte túto aktivitu do každodennej rutiny. Možno si všimnete, že Vaše dieťa chce strany v knihách a časopisoch otáčať samostatne.</p><p><strong>Čo sa Vaše dieťa učí: </strong>Pri otáčaní stránok v knihe si dieťa trénuje jemnú motoriku. Myslenie Vášho dieťaťa sa posilňuje aj tým, že si vytvára súvislosti medzi tým, čo je na stranách a krokom otočenia, aby si pozrelo nový obrázok.</p>",

Používajte krátke a jednoduché vety.

Dovoľte mu, aby sa knihy dotýkalo, dávalo si ju do úst (ak je to bezpečné) a skúmalo ju aj inými spôsobmi. Ak dieťa počas čítania vydáva zvuky, nechajte ho \"čítať\" si tiež. Počúvajte ho a reagujte opakovaním jeho zvukov, kladením otázok a chválením. Keď si všimnete, že dieťa už nemá záujem - odvráti pohľad alebo protestuje iným spôsobom - trpezlivo počkajte, kým sa jeho pozornosť vráti ku knihe a pokračujte. Ak ho kniha už nezaujíma, vráťte sa k nej neskôr. </p><p><strong>Čo sa Vaše dieťa učí: </strong>Spoločné čítanie a prezeranie kníh je dôležité pre rozvoj komunikačných schopností a jazyka Vášho dieťaťa.</p>",
