Never withhold food from a baby in an attempt to cause weight loss. To grow and develop as they should, babies need proper nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months of life. For formula-fed babies, make sure you follow the instructions to prepare the feeds correctly (right amount of water and powder) and follow the instruction for the number of the feeds and the amount of feeds per day."

Доказано и научно потвърдено е, че кърменето, особено продължителното – поне 12 месеца, предпазва детето от затлъстяване по-късно в детството и в зряла възраст. За бебета на изкуствено хранене (хранени само с мляко за кърмачета) винаги съществува опасност от наднормено тегло. За бебета с наднормено тегло или затлъстяване, лекарският съвет може да бъде полезен. Никога не спирайте напълно храненето на бебето в опит да предизвикате загуба на тегло. За да растат и за да се развиват както трябва, бебетата се нуждаят от правилно хранене и единствено и само от кърмене през първите 6 месеца от живота. За бебета, хранени с мляко за кърмачета (адаптирано мляко), не забравяйте да следвате инструкциите за правилна подготовка на поредната порция (точното количество вода и прах) и да следвате инструкциите за броя на храненията и количеството мляко на ден."

A fost dovedit și confirmat științific că alăptarea, în special cea prelungită - cel puțin 12 luni, protejează copilul de obezitate mai târziu în copilărie și la vârsta adultă. În cazul bebelușilor care primesc hrană artificială, există întotdeauna pericolul de supraponderabilitate. În cazul bebelușilor supraponderali sau obezi, poate fi de ajutor sfatul medicului copilului. Nu reține niciodată un bebeluș de la hrănire în încercarea de a-l face să piardă în greutate. Pentru a crește și a se dezvolta așa cum ar trebui, bebelușii au nevoie de o nutriție adecvată, de alăptare exclusivă la sân în primele 6 luni de viață. În cazul bebelușilor hrăniți cu formulă de lapte, asigură-te că urmezi instrucțiunile de preparare corectă a porțiilor (cantitatea corectă de apă și de formulă) și urmează instrucțiunile privind cantitatea și numărul de mese pe zi."

Bolesti u djetinjstvu mogu ometati rast djeteta, no uz odgovarajuću roditeljsku podršku taj je uticaj uglavnom privremenog karaktera.    Rast Vašeg djeteta procjenjuje se mjerenjem parametara rasta: tjelesne mase (težine), tjelesne dužine (dijete se mjeri u ležećem položaju sve do 2. godine) i obima glave, te njihovim poređenjem sa standardima rasta koje je izdala Svjetska zdravstvena organizacija (SZO). Za potrebe svakodnevne prakse, ovi standardi su pretočeni u grafikone rasta koji su izrađeni posebno za dječake, a posebno za djevojčice.\tPrilikom svake preventivne posjete pedijatru (pet posjeta u prvih šest mjeseci), Vaše dijete će biti izmjereno, a dobijene vrijednosti unijete u karte (grafikone) rasta. Putem tih grafikona će se dalje pratiti kojom brzinom Vaše dijete napreduje i da li je taj tempo u skladu sa ustaljenim obrascem rasta.       \tNa rođenju. Prosječne vrijednosti tjelesne mase i tjelesne dužine beba na rođenju nešto su veće kod dječaka (oko 3600 g i 51,5 cm) nego kod djevojčica (oko 3500 g i 50,5 cm), što jasno odražava uticaj genetskih faktora na rast. Obim glave je u prosjeku oko 35 cm.\tPrvi mjesec. Nemojte se iznenaditi ako Vaše dijete u prvim danima po rođenju izgubi i do 10% svoje tjelesne mase. To je očekivano, a gubitak je privremen i nadoknadiće se uz odgovarajuću njegu i ishranu, najbolje majčinim mlijekom, najkasnije do kraja druge nedjelje života.\tNarednih dana se očekuje da dijete počne da dobija na težini, u prosjeku 20 do 30 grama dnevno.\tPrvi mjesec je mjesec privikavanja djeteta na uslove života u spoljašnjem okruženju i varijacije u rastu su velike. Može se desiti da Vaše dijete dobije samo 400 grama, a ako je bilo krupno na rođenju, ako često traži da sisa i dobro spava – 1000 grama ili više. U ovom periodu dijete poraste u prosjeku 4,5 do 5 cm.  \tRast glave se posebno prati jer je uslovljen brzinom rasta mozga. Mozak se puni mnoštvom informacija iz okruženja i raste fantastičnom brzinom, te u ovom mjesecu obim glave može porasti za oko 2,5 cm.\tPrvo tromjesečje. Vaše dijete će nastaviti da raste približno istom brzinom koju je uspostavilo tokom prvih nekoliko nedjelja života. Očekuje se da beba tokom cijelog ovog perioda dobija 700 do 900 grama u težini, 2,5 do 4 cm u dužini i da se obim glave povećava za 1,2 cm mjesečno. Naravno, navedene brojke predstavljaju samo prosječne vrijednosti i blaža odstupanja su moguća a da dijete ostane u okvirima predviđenim za tipičan rast. Važno je da znate da će se napredovanje Vašeg djeteta procjenjivati na osnovu sveukupne slike.       \tPola godine. Od četvrtog do sedmog mjeseca dijete će nastaviti da dobija u težini oko 450 do 550 g mjesečno. Za ovo vrijeme ono će porasti oko 6 cm, a obim glave će se povećati za oko 2,5 cm. \tU periodu od 4. do 6. mjeseca većina djece udvostruči tjelesnu masu koju su imala na rođenju.\tGodina dana. Do kraja prve godine dijete uglavnom utrostruči tjelesnu masu koju je imalo na rođenju, a procenat masnog tkiva dostiže svoj vrhunac. Za ovo vrijeme dijete poraste oko 25 cm (50% tjelesne dužine s rođenja), a obim glave se poveća za 12,5 cm (u prosjeku).  Rast svakog djeteta je jedinstven i uglavnom slijedi obrazac rasta utvrđen u prvim mjesecima života, a redovna mjerenja i grafikoni rasta pomažu nam da ga uredno pratimo.   "

Sigurohuni që të planifikoni një vizitë tek pediatri për një ekzaminim dhe diagnostifikim shtesë, si dhe për të përcaktuar dinamikën e monitorimit të mëtejshëm të rritjes!"

În cazul bebelușilor care primesc hrană artificială, există întotdeauna pericolul de supraponderabilitate. În cazul bebelușilor supraponderali sau obezi, poate fi de ajutor sfatul medicului copilului. Nu reține niciodată un bebeluș de la hrănire în încercarea de a-l face să piardă în greutate. Pentru a crește și a se dezvolta așa cum ar trebui, bebelușii au nevoie de o nutriție adecvată, de alăptare exclusivă la sân în primele 6 luni de viață. În cazul bebelușilor hrăniți cu formulă de lapte, asigură-te că urmezi instrucțiunile de preparare corectă a porțiilor (cantitatea corectă de apă și de formulă) și urmează instrucțiunile privind cantitatea și numărul de mese pe zi."

Bolesti u detinjstvu mogu delovati ometajuće ali uz vašu odgovarajuću podršku uglavnom imaju privremen uticaj.    Rast vašeg deteta se procenjuje merenjem  parametara rasta: telesne mase ( težine), telesne dužine (dete se meri u ležećem položaju sve do 2 godine) i obima glave, te njihovim poređenjem sa standardima rasta  koje je izdala Svetska zdravstvena organizacija (SZO).  Za svakodnevnu praksu ovi standardi su pretočeni u grafikone rasta koji su izrađeni posebno za dečake a posebno za devojčice.\tPri svakoj preventivnoj poseti kod pedijatra ( 5 poseta u prvih 6 meseci) vaše dete če biti izmereno a dobijene vrednosti unete u karte rasta  putem kojih će se pratiti kojom brzinom vaše dete napreduje i da li se drži ustaljenog obrasca rasta.       \tNa rođenju Prosečne vrednosti telesne mase i telesne dužine, na rođenju, su nešto veće kod dečaka (oko 3600 gr i 51,5 cm)  u odnosu na devojčice ( oko 3500 gr i 50,5 cmi ), što jasno odražava uticaj genetskih faktora na rast. Obim glave je u proseku oko 35 cm.\tPrvi mesec Nemojte se iznenaditi ako vaše dete u  prvim danima po rođenju izgubi i do 10% svoje telesne mase. To je očekivano, a gubitak je privremen i nadoknadiće se uz odgovarajuću negu i ishranu, najbolje majčinim mlekom, najdalje do kraja druge nedelje života.\tNarednih dana se očekuje da dete počne da dobija na težini, u proseku  20 do 30 grama dnevno.\tPrvi mesec je mesec privikavanja deteta na uslove života u spoljašnjem okruženju i postoje velike varijacije u rastu. Zato se može desiti da vaše dete dobije samo 400 grama ili ako je krupno rođeno,  često traži da sisa i dobro spava  dobije1000 grama i više. Za ovo vreme poraste u dužinu u proseku  4,5 do 5 cm.  \tRast glave se posebno prati jer je uslovljen brzinom rasta mozga. Mozak se puni mnoštvom informacija iz okruženja i raste fantastičnom brzinom te u ovom mesecu obim glave može porasti za  oko 2,5 cm\tPrvo tromesečje Vaše dete će nastaviti da raste približno istom brzinom koju je uspostavilo tokom prvih nekoliko nedelja života. Tokom ovih meseci se očekuje da dobija  700 do 900 gr u težini,  2,5 do 4 cm u dužini  i 1,2 cm obim glave mesečno. Navedene brojke predstavljaju samo prosečne vrednosti tako da su za tipičan rast moguća blaža odstupanja i napredovanje vašeg deteta će se procenjivati na osnovu sveukupne slike.       \tPola godine  Od četvrtog do sedmog meseca dete će nastaviti da dobija mesečno u težini oko 450 do 550 gr, Za ovo vreme će porasti u dužinu oko 6 cm a obim glave će se povećati za oko 2,5 cm.     \tU periodu od 4. do 6. meseca većina dece udvostruči svoju telesnu masu sa rođenja.\tGodina dana Do kraja prve godine dete uglavnom utrostruči svoju težinu sa rođenja a procenat masnog  tkiva dostiže svoj vrhunac.  Za ovo vreme dete poraste u dužini oko  25 cm  ( 50% telesne dužine sa rođenja) a obim glave se poveća za 12,5 cm u proseku.  Rast svakog deteta je jedinstven, i uglavnom sledi obrazac rasta utvrđen u prvim mesecima života a redovna merenja i vođenje karta rasta nam pomažu da ga uredno pratimo."

Dete je možda bolesno i potrebno mu je više pažnje i nege ili pomoći pri obrocima.Ovo su neka važna pitanja koja  treba da razmotrite da bi se pomoglo u otkrivanju uzroka problema sa rastom i napredovanjem:Da li dete jede dovoljno često? Uz dojenje, detetu  uzrasta 6-8 meseci potrebna su 2-3 obroka, a od 9. meseca 3-4 obroka druge hrane. Dodatne hranljive užine, kao što je komad voća ili hleb sa zdravim namazom, mogu biti potrebne 1-2 puta dnevno. Deci sa kašnjenjem ili smetnjama u razvoju nekada je potrebna dodatna pomoć i vreme za hranjenje.\tDa li dete dobija dovoljno hrane? Detetu uzrasta 6-8 meseci potrebno je u početku 2-3 kašičice hrane, a količina se postepeno povećava do ½ šolje (od 250ml), za svaki obrok u uzrastu 9-12meseci.\tDa li detetovi obroci sadrže dovoljno energije i hranljivih materija? Hrana koja pomaže rast deteta je pasulj, orašasti plodovi, meso, riba, jaja, mlečni proizvodi, žitarice i mahunarke. Svakodnevo uključivanje hrane životinjskog porekla je posebno značajno. Mala količina ulja može dati dodatnu energiju. Kvalitetna „hrana za rast“ posebno je važna da bi se obezbedio odgovarajući rast u težini i u visini. Namirnice kao što su prerađena masna hrana ili slatke grickalice nisu bogate vitaminima i mineralima ni drugim važnim nutrijentima i mogu dovesti do prekomernog porasta težine bez odgovarajućeg rasta u visinu.\tDa li dete dobija previše slatke hrane (kolači, keks) ili zaslađenih tečnosti (sokovi, čajevi) ili drugu nezdravu hranu za obroke ili užine. Smanjite ili zamenite ovu hranu hranljivim namirnicama, kao što su voće, povrće, žitarice, meso prema preporukama za ishranu.\tDa li dete dobija previše mlečne formule ili drugih tečnosti (sokovi, čajevi) a nedovoljno čvrste hrane. Tečnost ispunjava želudac i smanjuje potrebu deteta za hranom.\tDa li dete odbija da jede? Ako dete ne voli ukus neke određene vrste hrane, treba mu ponuditi drugu. Nove namirnice traba uvoditi postepeno.\tDa li je dete bolesno? Bolesno dete treba ohrabrivati da jede male, češće obroke. Podoji treba da budu češći. Posle bolesti, dete treba da jede više nego uobičajeno da bi  nadoknadilo izgubljenu težinu, energiju i nutrijente. Ukoliko je dete često bolesno, treba potražiti pomoć lekara.\tDa li dete dobija dovoljno namirnica koje sadrže vitamin A? Majčino mleko je bogato vitaminom A. Ostale namirnice koje ga sadrže su džigerica, jaja, mlečni proizvodi, žuto i narandžasto voće i povrće i zeleno lisnato povrće. Ukoliko ove namirnice nisu raspoložive u dovoljnoj količini, detetu treba dati suplementaciju (tablete ili sirup svakih 4-6 meseci).\tDa li dete dobija mlečnu formulu iz flašice? Ako se dete hrani mlečnom formulom, preporučuje se čista šolja ili čašica radije nego flašica sa cuclom.\tDa li se hrana priprema i čuva na čist i bezbedan način? Ako ne, dete će često biti bolesno. Sirovu hranu treba dobro prati ili kuvati, koristeći čistu vodu iz bezbednog izvora. Kuvanu hranu treba odmah pojesti; preostalu hranu treba pažljivo čuvati i pravilno podgrejati pre jela.\tDa li je dete često samo ili prepušteno brizi starije dece?  Detetu je potrebno više pažnje  od strane odraslih, posebno za vreme obroka."

Tečnost ispunjava želudac i smanjuje potrebu deteta za hranom.\tDa li dete odbija da jede? Ako dete ne voli ukus neke određene vrste hrane, treba mu ponuditi drugu. Nove namirnice traba uvoditi postepeno.\tDa li je dete bolesno? Bolesno dete treba ohrabrivati da jede male, češće obroke. Podoji treba da budu češći. Posle bolesti, dete treba da jede više nego uobičajeno da bi  nadoknadilo izgubljenu težinu, energiju i nutrijente. Ukoliko je dete često bolesno, treba potražiti pomoć lekara.\tDa li dete dobija dovoljno namirnica koje sadrže vitamin A? Majčino mleko je bogato vitaminom A. Ostale namirnice koje ga sadrže su džigerica, jaja, mlečni proizvodi, žuto i narandžasto voće i povrće i zeleno lisnato povrće. Ukoliko ove namirnice nisu raspoložive u dovoljnoj količini, detetu treba dati suplementaciju (tablete ili sirup svakih 4-6 meseci).\tDa li dete dobija mlečnu formulu iz flašice? Ako se dete hrani mlečnom formulom, preporučuje se čista šolja ili čašica radije nego flašica sa cuclom.\tDa li se hrana priprema i čuva na čist i bezbedan način? Ako ne, dete će često biti bolesno. Sirovu hranu treba dobro prati ili kuvati, koristeći čistu vodu iz bezbednog izvora. Kuvanu hranu treba odmah pojesti; preostalu hranu treba pažljivo čuvati i pravilno podgrejati pre jela.\tDa li je dete često samo ili prepušteno brizi starije dece?  Detetu je potrebno više pažnje  od strane odraslih, posebno za vreme obroka."

Bolesti u detinjstvu mogu delovati ometajuće ali uz vašu odgovarajuću podršku uglavnom imaju privremen uticaj.    Rast vašeg deteta se procenjuje merenjem  parametara rasta: telesne mase ( težine), telesne dužine (dete se meri u ležećem položaju sve do 2 godine) i obima glave, te njihovim poređenjem sa standardima rasta  koje je izdala Svetska zdravstvena organizacija (SZO).  Za svakodnevnu praksu ovi standardi su pretočeni u grafikone rasta koji su izrađeni posebno za dečake a posebno za devojčice.\tPri svakoj preventivnoj poseti kod pedijatra ( 5 poseta u prvih 6 meseci) vaše dete če biti izmereno a dobijene vrednosti unete u karte rasta  putem kojih će se pratiti kojom brzinom vaše dete napreduje i da li se drži ustaljenog obrasca rasta.       \tNa rođenju Prosečne vrednosti telesne mase i telesne dužine, na rođenju, su nešto veće kod dečaka (oko 3600 gr i 51,5 cm)  u odnosu na devojčice ( oko 3500 gr i 50,5 cmi ), što jasno odražava uticaj genetskih faktora na rast. Obim glave je u proseku oko 35 cm.\tPrvi mesec Nemojte se iznenaditi ako vaše dete u  prvim danima po rođenju izgubi i do 10% svoje telesne mase. To je očekivano, a gubitak je privremen i nadoknadiće se uz odgovarajuću negu i ishranu, najbolje majčinim mlekom, najdalje do kraja druge nedelje života.\tNarednih dana se očekuje da dete počne da dobija na težini, u proseku  20 do 30 grama dnevno.\tPrvi mesec je mesec privikavanja deteta na uslove života u spoljašnjem okruženju i postoje velike varijacije u rastu. Zato se može desiti da vaše dete dobije samo 400 grama ili ako je krupno rođeno,  često traži da sisa i dobro spava  dobije1000 grama i više. Za ovo vreme poraste u dužinu u proseku  4,5 do 5 cm.  \tRast glave se posebno prati jer je uslovljen brzinom rasta mozga. Mozak se puni mnoštvom informacija iz okruženja i raste fantastičnom brzinom te u ovom mesecu obim glave može porasti za  oko 2,5 cm\tPrvo tromesečje Vaše dete će nastaviti da raste približno istom brzinom koju je uspostavilo tokom prvih nekoliko nedelja života. Tokom ovih meseci se očekuje da dobija  700 do 900 gr u težini,  2,5 do 4 cm u dužini  i 1,2 cm obim glave mesečno. Navedene brojke predstavljaju samo prosečne vrednosti tako da su za tipičan rast moguća blaža odstupanja i napredovanje vašeg deteta će se procenjivati na osnovu sveukupne slike.       \tPola godine  Od četvrtog do sedmog meseca dete će nastaviti da dobija mesečno u težini oko 450 do 550 gr, Za ovo vreme će porasti u dužinu oko 6 cm a obim glave će se povećati za oko 2,5 cm.     \tU periodu od 4. do 6. meseca većina dece udvostruči svoju telesnu masu sa rođenja.\tGodina dana Do kraja prve godine dete uglavnom utrostruči svoju težinu sa rođenja a procenat masnog  tkiva dostiže svoj vrhunac.  Za ovo vreme dete poraste u dužini oko  25 cm  ( 50% telesne dužine sa rođenja) a obim glave se poveća za 12,5 cm u proseku.  Rast svakog deteta je jedinstven, i uglavnom sledi obrazac rasta utvrđen u prvim mesecima života a redovna merenja i vođenje karta rasta nam pomažu da ga uredno pratimo."

Došlo je vreme prohodavanja i prve reči a telesni rast deteta lagano usporava iako je i dalje intenzivan.   U poslednjem tromesečju odojčad mesečno dobijaju u proseku oko 200 do 250 gr u težini i oko 1 cm u dužini. Tokom ovog perioda obim glave kod deteta će porasti još za 1 cm.Do kraja prve godine dete uglavnom utrostruči svoju težinu sa rođenja a procenat masnog  tkiva dostiže svoj vrhunac.  Za ovo vreme dete poraste u dužini oko  25 cm  ( 50% telesne dužine sa rođenja) a obim glave se poveća za 12,5 cm u proseku. Telesni rast vašeg deteta zavisi od nasleđa ali imajte na umu da se odvija uz vašu svakodnevnu podršku i da ste i vi zaslužni za njegovo uspešno napredovanje."

Namirnice kao što su prerađena masna hrana ili slatke grickalice nisu bogate vitaminima i mineralima ni drugim važnim nutrijentima i mogu dovesti do prekomernog porasta težine bez odgovarajućeg rasta u visinu.\tDa li dete dobija previše slatke hrane (kolači, keks) ili zaslađenih tečnosti (sokovi, čajevi) ili drugu nezdravu hranu za obroke ili užine. Smanjite ili zamenite ovu hranu hranljivim namirnicama, kao što su voće, povrće, žitarice, meso prema preporukama za ishranu.\tDa li dete dobija previše mlečne formule ili drugih tečnosti (sokovi, čajevi) a nedovoljno čvrste hrane. Tečnost ispunjava želudac i smanjuje potrebu deteta za hranom.\tDa li dete odbija da jede? Ako dete ne voli ukus neke određene vrste hrane, treba mu ponuditi drugu. Nove namirnice traba uvoditi postepeno.\tDa li je dete bolesno? Bolesno dete treba ohrabrivati da jede male, češće obroke. Podoji treba da budu češći. Posle bolesti, dete treba da jede više nego uobičajeno da bi  nadoknadilo izgubljenu težinu, energiju i nutrijente. Ukoliko je dete često bolesno, treba potražiti pomoć lekara.\tDa li dete dobija dovoljno namirnica koje sadrže vitamin A? Majčino mleko je bogato vitaminom A. Ostale namirnice koje ga sadrže su džigerica, jaja, mlečni proizvodi, žuto i narandžasto voće i povrće i zeleno lisnato povrće. Ukoliko ove namirnice nisu raspoložive u dovoljnoj količini, detetu treba dati suplementaciju (tablete ili sirup svakih 4-6 meseci).\tDa li dete dobija mlečnu formulu iz flašice? Ako se dete hrani mlečnom formulom, preporučuje se čista šolja ili čašica radije nego flašica sa cuclom.\tDa li se hrana priprema i čuva na čist i bezbedan način? Ako ne, dete će često biti bolesno. Sirovu hranu treba dobro prati ili kuvati, koristeći čistu vodu iz bezbednog izvora. Kuvanu hranu treba odmah pojesti; preostalu hranu treba pažljivo čuvati i pravilno podgrejati pre jela.\tDa li je dete često samo ili prepušteno brizi starije dece?  Detetu je potrebno više pažnje  od strane odraslih, posebno za vreme obroka."

Do navršene druge godine većina deca dobije još 2 do 2,5 kg,  poraste za 12 -12,5 cm, u proseku 1 cm mesečno, i dostigne skoro polovinu svoje krajnje visine.\t U ovom periodu glava poraste u proseku još za 2 -2,5 cm i dostigne skoro  90% svog ukupnog rasta.\tOd treće godine Telesni rast deteta se odvija i kroz promene u proporcijama. Novorođenče je imalo relativno veliku glavu i kratke noge i ruke dok sada glava usporava rast a raste telo,  naročito ruke i noge.\tProcenat masti u telu se takođe smanjuje što se vidi kroz vitkije ekstremitete i manje okruglu glavu.\tIako rast pratimo linearno on se ipak sastoji od niza malih skokova. Deca dobiju malo u težini a zatim krenu da rastu u visinu.\tPoznate su i sezonske varijacije: deca u  proleće rastu brže u visinu dok od jeseni više dobijaju u težini.  \tOd treće godine nadalje, do puberteta, rast je uglavnom ujednačen.\tVećina dece, u tom periodu, godišnje poraste u visini  5,0 -7,5 cm  i 2-3 kg  u težini.\tGlava će za narednih destak godina porasti još 3-4 cm.\tU ovom uzrastu već postoji statistički značajna pozitivna korelacija između visine deteta i srednje visine roditelja, odnosno može se proceniti da li dete raste u skladu sa svojim genetskim potencijalom. Genetski potencijal rasta („ciljna visina”) se procenjuje na osnovu izračunavanja srednje visine roditelja prema jednačinama različitim za dečaka odnosno devojčice ( Tannerov metod)            Ciljna visina za dečaka (cm) = (visina oca + visina majke)/2 + 6,5            Ciljna visina za devojčicu (cm) = (visina oca + visina majke)/2 – 6,5 Poremećaj u rastu Rast je složen proces, podložan uticaju brojnih faktora od kojih neki mogu delovati ometajuće i poremetiti utvrđen obrazac rasta kao što su: neadekvatna ishrana,  hronične bolesti, endokrini poremećaji, lekovi, porodične neprilike i dr, te je redovno praćenje rasta deteta prilika da se poremećaj na vreme otkrije i interveniše   \tDeci koja su rođena pre vremena ili sa malom telesnom masom/dužinom  na rođenju, potrebno je posvetiti posebnu pažnju jer u slučaju da posle dve godine ne postignu visinu u skladu sa visinom svojih roditelja, odnosno svojim genetskim potencijalom rasta, zahtevaju neodložno ispitivanje.    Vaše dete očekuje od vas  da mu pružite odgovarajuće uslove za optimalni rast i razvoj!"

U našoj sredini se koriste grafikoni rasta Svetske zdravstvene organizacije na kojima naznačene linije (+/- 2SD u odnosu na središnju vrednost) predstavljaju granične vrednosti normalnog opsega rasta dece istog pola i uzrasta. Međutim, kada je u pitanju visina, dete čija visina značajno premašuje očekivanu visinu za njegov uzrast (postiže vrednost + 3 SD na grafikonu rasta) detet smatramo veoma visokim. Ako visina deteta premašuje granične vrednosti, dobrog je zdravstvenog stanja, u kliničkoj slici nema drugih znakova odstupanja a roditelji ili bliski srodnici su visoki, onda je to detetova očekivana visina.Retko se dešava da je detetu, koje ima visinu (dužinu) iznad gornje granične vrednosti za pol i uzrast, ili postiže neobičan skok u visini, ili ima neke pridružene zdravstvene probleme, potrebno detaljnije ispitivanje. Tada se razmišlja o mogućim naslednim uzrocima ili povišenom lučenju hormona rasta.Promene u genskoj ili hromozomskoj osnovi (Marfanov, Sotosov, Beckwith- Wiedemannov, Klinefelterov sindrom,..) pored istaknutog rasta u visinu daju i druge karakteristike u kliničkoj slici deteta koje ukazuju na mogući nasledni poremećaj.    Rast kostiju i mišića, a samim tim rast u visinu, pod snažnim je uticajem hormona rasta. Povišene vrednosti ovog hormona u periodu rasta deteta, kada su hrskavice pri krajevima kostiju još otvorene, dovodi do pojave gigantizma: veoma visokog rasta sa dugačkim udovima i naglašenom bradom. Ako kod odraslih, u periodu kada je završen rast kostiju, dođe do porasta hormona rasta, javiće se klinička slika akromegalije, koja se odlikuje  porastom šaka, stopala istaknutih delova lica. Hormon rasta je jedan od hormona koje luči hipofiza, mala žlezda smeštena na bazi mozga, odmah ispod dela mozga koji nazivamo hipotalamus, sa kojim u sprezi reguliše i rad drugih žlezda sa unutrašnjim lučenjem.Kod sumnje na pojavu gigantskog rasta dete se upućuje endokrinologu na rengenološko i laboratorijsko ispitivanja kako bi se procenilo lučenje hormona rasta i stanje hipofize. Nekad se desi da se u predelu hipofize otkrije manji tumor čije je lečenje, u poslednje vreme, sve uspešnije.  Ako vaše dete ima visinu čija vrednost značajno premašuje očekivanu visinu za detetov kalendarski uzrast  (+3SD na grafikonu rasta) ili ste primetili da je došlo do neočekivano naglog skoka rasta u visinu, razgovarajte sa izabranim pedijatrom o rastu i ponašanju vašeg deteta. "

U našoj sredini se koriste grafikoni rasta Svetske zdravstvene organizacije na kojima naznačene linije (+/- 2SD u odnosu na središnju vrednost) predstavljaju granične vrednosti normalnog opsega rasta dece istog pola i uzrasta. Međutim, kada je u pitanju visina, dete čija visina značajno premašuje očekivanu visinu za njegov uzrast (postiže vrednost + 3 SD na grafikonu rasta) detet smatramo veoma visokim. Ako visina deteta premašuje granične vrednosti, dobrog je zdravstvenog stanja, u kliničkoj slici nema drugih znakova odstupanja a roditelji ili bliski srodnici su visoki, onda je to detetova očekivana visina.Retko se dešava da je detetu, koje ima visinu (dužinu) iznad gornje granične vrednosti za pol i uzrast, ili postiže neobičan skok u visini, ili ima neke pridružene zdravstvene probleme, potrebno detaljnije ispitivanje. Tada se razmišlja o mogućim naslednim uzrocima ili povišenom lučenju hormona rasta.Promene u genskoj ili hromozomskoj osnovi (Marfanov, Sotosov, Beckwith- Wiedemannov, Klinefelterov sindrom,..) pored istaknutog rasta u visinu daju i druge karakteristike u kliničkoj slici deteta koje ukazuju na mogući nasledni poremećaj.    Rast kostiju i mišića, a samim tim rast u visinu, pod snažnim je uticajem hormona rasta. Povišene vrednosti ovog hormona u periodu rasta deteta, kada su hrskavice pri krajevima kostiju još otvorene, dovodi do pojave gigantizma: veoma visokog rasta sa dugačkim udovima i naglašenom bradom. Ako kod odraslih, u periodu kada je završen rast kostiju, dođe do porasta hormona rasta, javiće se klinička slika akromegalije, koja se odlikuje  porastom šaka, stopala istaknutih delova lica. Hormon rasta je jedan od hormona koje luči hipofiza, mala žlezda smeštena na bazi mozga, odmah ispod dela mozga koji nazivamo hipotalamus, sa kojim u sprezi reguliše i rad drugih žlezda sa unutrašnjim lučenjem.Kod sumnje na pojavu gigantskog rasta dete se upućuje endokrinologu na rengenološko i laboratorijsko ispitivanja kako bi se procenilo lučenje hormona rasta i stanje hipofize. Nekad se desi da se u predelu hipofize otkrije manji tumor čije je lečenje, u poslednje vreme, sve uspešnije.  Ako vaše dete ima visinu čija vrednost značajno premašuje očekivanu visinu za detetov kalendarski uzrast  (+3SD na grafikonu rasta) ili ste primetili da je došlo do neočekivano naglog skoka rasta u visinu, razgovarajte sa izabranim pedijatrom o rastu i ponašanju vašeg deteta."

Never withhold food from a baby in an attempt to cause weight loss. To grow and develop as they should, babies need proper nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months of life. For formula-fed babies, make sure you follow the instructions to prepare the feeds correctly (right amount of water and powder) and follow the instruction for the number of the feeds and the amount of feeds per day."
