В центре нашего внимания — выживание, развитие и благополучие каждого ребенка.</p><p>Больше всего усилий ЮНИСЕФ направляет на самых уязвимых — детей в возрасте до 8 лет; детей c инвалидностью; детей, проживающих за чертой бедности и оставшихся без родительской заботы; подростков, находящихся в конфликте с законом; детей и женщин, переживших насилие и/или ставших его свидетелями. ЮНИСЕФ осуществляет свою деятельность при участии и в интересах уязвимых детей и подростков в 21 стране и территории региона Европы и Центральной Азии с целью добиться того, чтобы все в регионе, как один, работали на благо наиболее уязвимых детей.</p><p>В своей работе по реализации права детей на раннее развитие ЮНИСЕФ опирается на принципы стимулирующего комплексного развития — формирование среды, которая создается лицами, осуществляющими уход, т. е. родителями. Для развития у каждого ребенка максимального потенциала ему необходимо обеспечить контроль за здоровьем, надлежащее питание, безопасность, защиту, внимательный уход, а их родителям и семьям поддержку. Поэтому ЮНИСЕФ в своей работе приоритетное внимание уделяет программам и проектам по развитию родительских знаний и навыков, а также поддержке семейного благополучия.</p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-image media--view-mode-default\"><div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">                  <div class=\"field__item\">  <img src=\"https://www.bebbo.app/sites/default/files/styles/content_1200xh_/public/2021-12/Bebbo%20Logo%20in%20Cyrilic.PNG?itok=SnOTPezZ\" width=\"894\" height=\"403\" alt=\"Bebbo\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-content-1200xh-\" /></div>          </div>  </article><p><strong>О приложении</strong></p><p>Приложение «Беббо» (Bebbo) было разработано ЮНИСЕФ для стран региона Европы и Центральной Азии.

Всички семейства се нуждаят от подкрепа, за да осигурят най-добрия старт в живота на своите деца. Уязвимите семейства, които са изправени пред допълнителни предизвикателства като бедност, увреждания или социално изключване, се нуждаят от повече помощ в сравнение с останалите, и те са във фокуса на нашето внимание.</p><p>УНИЦЕФ разбира, че родителите и другите лица, полагащи грижа, са основните лица, които предоставят пълноценна грижа на малките деца, и в контекста на всички свои програми определя като приоритетно изграждането на родителски умения и подпомагането на благосъстоянието на родителите. </p><p>За приложението</p><p>Приложението Беббо е разработено от Регионалния офис на УНИЦЕФ за Европа и Централна Азия въз основа на прототип “HaloBeba”, разработен от офиса на УНИЦЕФ в Сърбия в тясно сътрудничество с Института за обществено здраве в Белград, Сърбия и Nordeus.</p><p>Беббо е приложение, което подпомага отзивчивата и позитивна родителска грижа. Неговото предназначение е да предоставя всестранна информация за ранното детско развитие и родителската грижа в ранна детска възраст в разбираем за родителите вид. Наред с това Беббо осигурява разпространение на послания и информация във връзка с превенцията и защитата на децата от COVID-19.</p><img alt=\"Bebbo logotype \" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6e601f8a-9a87-47a3-b938-28388049b21f\" src=\"https://www.bebbo.app/sites/default/files/inline-images/Bebbo%20logotype%20.jpg\" class=\"align-center\" /><p>Приложението може също така да се използва от доставчици на услуги като ресурс в тяхната работа с родители и като инструмент за изграждане на отношения на доверие и партньорство в полза на малките деца.</p><p>Приложението е разработено, с цел да помага на родителите да прилагат стимулиращи развитието практики, включващи игри и дейности с техните деца, както и да проследяват растежа, развитието и здравословното състояние на своите деца. </p><p>Приложението съдържа богата библиотека от статии и видеоматериали, групирани в следните тематични категории:</p><ul><li>Игра и учене                                         </li>\t<li>Отзивчиви родителски грижи         </li>\t<li>Здраве и благосъстояние                 </li>\t<li>Хранене и кърмене</li>\t<li>Безопасност и защита</li>\t<li>Благосъстояние на родителите</li></ul><p>Приложението използва въведената от родителя информация за датата на раждане и пола на детето и други данни за него, за да предлага на вниманието на родителя подходящо съдържание и индивидуализирани напътствия.</p><p>Част от съдържанието в приложението е използвано, адаптирано и преведено с разрешението на Raising Children Network Australia (<a href=\"https://raisingchildren.net.au/\">raisingchildren.net.au</a>),<a> Real Play Coalition (</a><a href=\"https://www.realplaycoalition.com\">https://www.realplaycoalition.com</a>), и Afinidata <a href=\"https://afinidata.com/en/home/\">https://afinidata.com/en/home/</a>).</p><p>Приложението изисква наличието на връзка с интернет за изтегляне и изобразяване на съдържанието.</p><p>Приложението може също така да функционира в режим офлайн, когато връзката с интернет е ограничена.
