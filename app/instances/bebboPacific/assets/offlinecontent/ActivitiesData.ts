Gently play with his feet and toes and gently tickle him. Touch the baby's finger one by one and at the same time say, \"This finger is… little thumb/mom's finger/dad's finger\" for each finger. While the baby is on his back, place a wind-up toy that produces sound (if you have one) next to or behind the baby. Check if the baby is looking for the source of the sound. Or gently shake a rattle or jar with beans and see if the baby looks for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a soft flat surface, on the bed or blanket, while lying on his back, gently tap or massage the baby's hands and fingers as you talk with her - for example, \"Here is your hand; here are your fingers,\" telling her what you are doing. Or you could sing a gentle song as you stroke their hands. Another idea is to use a simple toy that you place where the baby can see it, but where he cannot reach it. Does he try? You might move the toy as the baby looks at it. As the baby gets older, you could encourage your baby to roll over to reach for the toy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many ideas for \"floor time\" as your baby grows! Place a blanket or a towel on the carpet, put the baby on his tummy so that his head is turned to one side. Lie next to the baby to encourage him. The baby can stay in this position as long as he likes it, but make sure that his head is turned to the left and the right side for about the same length of time. Again, you can put favorite toys or objects in front of the baby, but so that they are just a little out of the baby's reach. As your baby gets older, encourage your baby to try to reach them and move in their direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"Tummy time\" is important for physical development. Make sure the time your baby spends on his tummy is a little longer each day. Observe your baby, so you can gently move the baby if he turns his face directly to the floor, as this can make breathing difficult. As he gets stronger over time, the baby will be able to raise his head and rise a little by pushing with his hands. These motions will later grow into rolling and crawling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Your Child is Learning: \u003C/strong\u003EThese are excellent opportunities to use simple games to create a positive, enjoyable environment for your child.

Your baby probably isn’t using a spoon yet, but fingers work, too! If you have not started yet, begin by putting some pieces of tasty food where your baby can reach them. She may immediately pick one up and put it in her mouth. If so, show your excitement (“You ate that all by yourself!” or “Did the fruit taste delicious?”). You could also nibble a piece yourself, showing how much you enjoyed it. Or put one piece in your baby’s mouth and see if she does the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Your Child is Learning: \u003C/strong\u003EDepending on your cultural traditions and your child’s development, you may continue occasionally feeding your baby. However, encouraging self-feeding strengthens your baby’s coordination and skill in using her fingers. These are skills that, years later, help her beginning to draw and write. When you talk to your baby during this time, you’re also encouraging language development (for example, names of foods).\u003C/p\u003E",

Simple rhymes help kids to pronounce words by building phonemic awareness through repeating difficult sound groups. The activity also encourages kids to become good listeners, as the rhymes often have a narrative, meaning children must keep listening to hear the whole story! Teaching your child when to sing their part in the rhyme is great for building social skills – such as turn-taking in conservation and listening.\u003C/p\u003E",
