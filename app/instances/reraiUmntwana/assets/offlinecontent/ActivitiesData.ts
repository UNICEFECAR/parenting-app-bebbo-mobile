Where are you going to go and what are you likely to find?  If it’s summer, you could look for different types of flowers (for example daisies), butterflies, bees and leaves, etc. In the winter, you could look for sticks, pine cones, acorns and any small animals. The children might like to draw pictures as you come up with ideas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScavenger hunts can have all sorts of different themes. You could look out for the nearest bus stop, lamp post, bench and road signs, or make a list of different types of transport to spot. Another example could be a list of ‘people who help us’, where children could set out to find the local fire station, police station and GP surgery – a great way to teach children about your local community and have an adventure at the same time! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsk the children which theme they’d like for their scavenger hunt and where they’d prefer to go.

Draw a giant spiral, like a snail’s shell, on the ground with chalk. Mark the centre with a star this is ‘home’ - and divide the rest of the spiral into spaces/segments with chalk lines. The children then take turns to play the game one at a time. Starting at the outside edge of the spiral, players hop on one leg along the spaces, trying not to touch the lines. Once they reach ‘home’, they turn around and hop back through the spiral to where they started. If they make it there and back without landing on any lines, they get to choose one of the spaces and write the first letter of their name inside it. The next player then takes their turn - but they must hop over/avoid any space with a letter in it. Players continue the game until there is an initial in each space. The person who has their letter in the most number of spaces at the end wins! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun fact: Snails keep the same shell their whole lives the shell grows bigger as they get older! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Your Child is Learning\u003C/strong\u003E: Snail space is a fun, social game that gets children outside skipping and jumping.

Twigs, leaves, dry flower heads and curly bark are always a favourite for natural art, but encourage them to find and use other things, too for example feathers, trailing vines, pine cones, pebbles, nut cases and small stems. Get the children to place all of their items in front of them and think about what they’d like to make. They could stack or link them together to build a sculpture, or arrange them to make a colourful collage, perhaps.

One child is chosen to be the ‘goose’, and walks around the outside of the circle, patting the heads of the other players - the ‘ducks’. With each pat, the walking goose says ‘Duck’, until they decide to choose one player and shout ‘Goose!’ instead. Then the chase begins! The chosen duck must get up and race after the goose before he/she completes the circle and sits in their spot. If the duck manages to catch and tag the goose in time, they sit back in their original place and the game continues in the same way for the next round. If, however, the goose completes the circle and sits down without being tagged, they become for a duck for the next round – and the game continues with a new goose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Guinness World Record for the largest game of Duck, Duck, Goose was made in 2011, when 2,145 students formed a massive circle around their school football stadium. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Your Child is Learning\u003C/strong\u003E: Active, imaginative play with friends helps kids to practise many key skills and improve a range of abilities.

Sing to the baby (even if you can't sing well, they won't know and will love hearing your voice!). Repeat songs and lullabies to calm the baby. Traditional lullabies connect him/her to your culture and community. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to introduce the baby to sounds is to use some everyday household items that make noise. For example, spoons and cups for measuring ingredients have interesting shapes and can make interesting sounds when tapped on a table. Gently move and shake a few measuring spoons or cups at a distance your baby can reach with his/her hands (or feet). Then give them to the baby to hold, study and shake. You can use them to create a rhythm and melody, watch your baby follow the changes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake a rattle from bells, tokens, or bottle caps. Offer the baby two rattles so that they are holding one rattle in each hand.

Working together to make part of a meal also lets you help improve your child’s language! As you work together, talk about what you are doing, using descriptive language that perhaps is a bit more complex than you might use at another time. For example, you might say, “I need a different spoon now. Can you find me one that is different or not the same? Oh, great, that one is bigger! Now we will put the cake in a pan. I need a big one. See those pans? Can you find a really big one?” You know your child’s language skills best. Make your conversation fun, not a test, but a way to use interesting, maybe new words in an activity they will love to do with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Your Child is Learning: \u003C/strong\u003EThis kind of activity, with lots of talking together with doing interesting things, will strengthen vocabulary and general language development.

Talking with your child during these times is also an important way to build their language and communication skills.\u003C/p\u003E",

Encourage various types of movement and encourage your child to enjoy them by smiling at the child or praising him every time you see them experiment with something new. This will also encourage your baby's motor development. Bath time also gives your child a chance to show many different emotions-excitements, curiosity, maybe upset as he or she must finish the bath, a bit of fear if the water seems too cold, and so on.

Gently play with his feet and toes and gently tickle him. Touch the baby's finger one by one and at the same time say, \"This finger is… little thumb/mom's finger/dad's finger\" for each finger. While the baby is on his back, place a wind-up toy that produces sound (if you have one) next to or behind the baby. Check if the baby is looking for the source of the sound. Or gently shake a rattle or jar with beans and see if the baby looks for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a soft flat surface, on the bed or blanket, while lying on his back, gently tap or massage the baby's hands and fingers as you talk with her - for example, \"Here is your hand; here are your fingers,\" telling her what you are doing. Or you could sing a gentle song as you stroke their hands. Another idea is to use a simple toy that you place where the baby can see it, but where he cannot reach it. Does he try? You might move the toy as the baby looks at it. As the baby gets older, you could encourage your baby to roll over to reach for the toy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many ideas for \"floor time\" as your baby grows! Place a blanket or a towel on the carpet, put the baby on his tummy so that his head is turned to one side. Lie next to the baby to encourage him. The baby can stay in this position as long as he likes it, but make sure that his head is turned to the left and the right side for about the same length of time. Again, you can put favorite toys or objects in front of the baby, but so that they are just a little out of the baby's reach. As your baby gets older, encourage your baby to try to reach them and move in their direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\"Tummy time\" is important for physical development. Make sure the time your baby spends on his tummy is a little longer each day. Observe your baby, so you can gently move the baby if he turns his face directly to the floor, as this can make breathing difficult. As he gets stronger over time, the baby will be able to raise his head and rise a little by pushing with his hands. These motions will later grow into rolling and crawling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Your Child is Learning: \u003C/strong\u003EThese are excellent opportunities to use simple games to create a positive, enjoyable environment for your child. During these games, your child learns to explore and control the movements of his body and head. A baby may be able to raise his head and support herself with his arms.  \u003C/p\u003E",

Stay close and talk to your baby about what he is doing: \"You're in! And now you're out!\" You can also pretend the box is a \"wagon\" and push and pull it around the room. This is especially fun for the baby in the winter months when going outside is limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying ball with the baby is another way to encourage walking.

Be patient and repeat a movement or facial expression. Give your child a short instruction she can understand - \"Come on, you try it!\" or (if your child is a bit older), \"Can you open your mouth like a fish? Let me see!\" and thereby encourage him.

In many families, grandparents or aunts and uncles cannot be with your child but will love to talk on the phone (if not, you can change the activity!). If your child is eager to talk, call a special family member or friend and get started by saying something like “Kama wants to tell you about what happened at school today.

You can say something like \"Wow, what do we have here - a bunch of different leaves ...!\" and use your curious facial expressions to arouse the child's curiosity. Allow them to explore them a bit, then encourage them to sort the items in different ways. With younger children, you might just say \"Let's put some of them together. Which ones would you like to put together?\" and then comment, for example, \"Oh, I see you put some big leaves together. Shall we put the small ones together also?\" Older children might be encouraged to sort according to different criteria. For example, by putting \"Green paper clips on one side and red on the other\". Praise your child when they try and talk as much as possible while the activity is taking place, “Ah, you took the red one. You put it with other reds”. Resist the urge to fix what the child does - it is not at this age a \"mistake.\" Instead, just describe what the child is doing - for example: “Oh, a yellow one with red ones”. Depending on the age, you can offer the child smaller items or offer items whose differences are harder to notice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is easiest to do at home, but if you have access to outdoor space, you might collect leaves, seeds, or other natural objects and think of different ways to sort those.  \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Your Child is Learning: \u003C/strong\u003EThis activity promotes your child’s cognitive development by sorting and pairing things.\u003C/p\u003E",

During all kinds of everyday activities, be sure to use words that your child is beginning to recognize — his name of course, but family members (you might say the name of a grandparent who is visiting, and notice if your child looks up to see the person, for example). What objects does your child know words for? Again, you can mention “Where is your bottle?” or “Let’s put on your shoes now.” Say the word clearly and notice if your child seems to understand by looking at or picking up the object. When you say “No” when your child is about to do something not safe, do you notice that your child reacts to the word?

You can say things like “Oh, look how you have made so many marks with that pencil.

When she gets interested, let her try it herself. For some children during this period, the expectation to throw the ball into the basket can be too demanding. Even if they aren't successful in throwing into the basket, the value and enjoyment of this activity is in practicing the throwing movement. Reward each attempt with praise, a smile, applause, and encouragement. Try to take turns throwing (you can say \"Now it's my turn! Now it's your turn!\" and other language such as \"That was a big throw!\" or \"Oh, the ball went onto the couch; let's get it!\") and cheer for every attempt regardless of success. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Your Child is Learning: \u003C/strong\u003EYour child develops gross motor skills and movement coordination by imitating your actions.
