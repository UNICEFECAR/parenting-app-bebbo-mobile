If you talk to him in everyday conversation, he will want to talk to you more.  If he sees that you enjoy talking with him, he'll begin to enjoy it too. Be patient--your child will still not be able to express himself well, so sometimes you'll need to help a bit: „Oh, is that what you played with your friend?  What else did you do?  Did you throw the ball?“ Talk about ordinary things that happen - what we do, where we have been, what we plan, what we like and what we don't. While reading books or telling stories, you can ask questions about what is happening.  Drawing and playing pretend are other ways to communicate and may support children who are sometimes unwilling to talk.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>\n\n<p>During this period, your child begins to learn how to <strong>express different feelings </strong>in an appropriate way.  He can find more and more ways to express emotions–  speech, explanation, gestures, or  play. Increasingly, he will be able to say what bothers him instead of yelling or hitting. </p>\n\n<p>During this period, children usually like to be <strong>surrounded by other people</strong>. You may see your child wanting to please his friends and wanting to be just like them.  Imaginary friends may still be an important part of your child's growing up, although real friends are the most important to him.  He is beginning to get along better and better with others.  You're likely to see him apologize, accept rules, wait for turns, and enjoy it when nice things happen to others.  Even though he can still be rather demanding or impatient, he more often <strong>cooperates and wants to help</strong> others.  At the same time, he may <strong>worry about new experiences</strong>, such as beginning preschool or playing with new children.</p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Encourage your child to be involved in various activities such as family routines, play, and socializing with other children. Share his enjoyment.  Create opportunities in which the child will feel useful and important- a little help while doing household chores, followed by praise, will encourage him to develop self-confidence. Avoid criticism, and praise the effort. If help is needed, give clear instructions and explanations.</p>\n\n<p>If he avoids trying something new or is already afraid of starting preschool, let him become familiar with the new situation and give it a try when he is ready.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Play is still a way for a child to learn about himself and about the world around him.   At this age your child will use his<strong> imagination</strong> intensively.  He will probably love to sing, dance, and pretend.  He is better able to know the difference between what is pretend and what is real.   However, at the same time he may <strong>hide the truth</strong> from his parents if he has done something he knows they do not like.  In his play, he may try <strong>different roles and behaviors</strong> - such as a doctor or a teacher.  During this period he may become more aware of his gender and gender roles.  </p>\n\n<p>Your child's learning also includes learning about his own body and other's bodies—including curiosity about boys' and girls' bodies.  Interest and curiosity about the body continues - both theirs and other people's bodies. You can find a child of this age watching his genitals or the genitals of other children with interest. </p>\n\n<p><strong> Concepts </strong>develop rapidly in this period and are foundational for later learning.  Your child in understanding more about  opposites (for example, low / high), and he can usually name quite a few <strong>letters and numbers</strong>, and print some of them.  He can correctly count objects up to 10.  His memory's getting better.  He probably remembers his address or phone number.  He may know the difference between left and right. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>In conversation and daily routines, talk about time concepts (morning, evening, today, etc. and days of the week), as well as other interesting concepts.  Use stories and children’s books to explore other concepts.  Enrich story reading or storytelling by asking your child what he thinks might happen next. Take walks around the community to explore sights and sounds that stimulate his thinking.  Create opportunities to use letters and numbers in daily activities, such as writing a note to help you remember foods to buy at the market. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is <strong>more and more physically skilled</strong> – now he can throw, catch, swing and climb, and build a tower with several small objects.  He can probably hop and perhaps even skip.  He finds it easier to <strong>dress himself</strong> now.  He's also able <strong>take care of more of his own needs</strong>.  For example, he may feed himself using a spoon or other utensils.  He may use the toilet independently and can brush his teeth wash himself without much help. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Remind him of safety rules and be sure to supervise physical activities as needed.  Create opportunities for your child to be active outdoors and teach him skills as he becomes eager to learn them.  Encourage him fine motor skills by providing simple materials for him to put together, and to draw pictures. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 49th to the 60th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period  give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Can't confidently walk, run, climb, jump or use stairs </li>\n\t<li>Can't answer simple questions (What's your name? Who is your family? What's your favorite story?)</li>\n\t<li>Can't follow a two-part direction (Put a cup on the table! Or Take the ball under the bed!) </li>\n\t<li>Can't perform daily routines such as eating or dressing on his own </li>\n\t<li>Seems to have difficulty holding a pencil</li>\n\t<li>Shows extreme behavior  (such as extremely fearful ,or aggressive, or sad)</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t talk about daily activities</li>\n\t<li>Doesn't show interest in interacting with either adults or children</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen. Be sure to limit the time in front of the screen to a maximum of one hour a day and make sure you spend every moment in front of the screen with your child to guide him through that experience. </p>",

During this period, she will <strong>understand most of the things you say</strong> to her, and may be able to guess what some new words mean.  You will also notice that, by the end of this year, your child’s sentences will be longer.  She will also be able to follow more <strong>complex instructions </strong>with two or three parts, such as “Please close the door and come with me.”</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>As always, listen to your child and have enjoyable conversations at all times of the day.  You will find that at this age, your child has a lot to talk about!  Involve her in whatever you are doing and use this as an opportunity to playfully give her instructions or introduce interesting new words into the conversation.   Read and tell stories with your child every day.  You can ask her about the story—what does she think will happen next? </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The period from the third to the fourth birthday is very important for your child’s emotional development. During this period, she learns how <strong>to identify different emotions</strong>.  At this age, she may be able to recognize basic feelings such as happiness, sadness, fear and anger.  You might see her show some other emotions such as fear of imaginary things, concern or worry about how others behave, or love and attachment to people she feels close to.</p>\n\n<p>If she has the opportunity you will see your child making her <strong>first friends</strong> during this year.  Now she will probably begin to <strong>play more cooperatively</strong> with others, in small groups.   Sharing is becoming easier—though not always—as she has some understanding of “mine” and “hers.” </p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to create a secure environment for your child.  This makes it easier for her to express and regulate or control her feelings.  As when she was younger, predictable daily routines help create that sense of security.  Help your child know what happens next and what the typical pattern of the day will be.  If she feels safe, it will be.</p>\n\n<p>Because these first friendships are important to your child, try to create opportunities for play with other children.  But stay close to the children, because the child’s social skills at this age are still not well developed, and misunderstandings or conflicts may happen.  You will help by reacting calmly and reasonably.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play is still the dominant way in which a child of this age learns and explores herself and the world around her, but now your child’s “playful learning”  is becoming <strong>much more imaginative</strong>.  She might have a tea party or pretend to be a doctor with a sick baby.  Some children have imaginary friends at this age.  For the most part, although she loves to pretend, she knows what it real and what’s make-believe.  This is also a period of intense <strong>fascination with the world</strong> around your child.  <strong>Questions, questions, questions</strong> help her learn—who?  What?  why?  She is probably very interested in her own body and others’ bodies. </p>\n\n<p>This year your child will also develop ideas about  opposites such as big / small, and more/less, as well as  other <strong>concepts</strong> such as “on”, “in,” and “below.”  Her memory is developing, allowing her to  learn short songs and sing them later. She will also begin to point to and name <strong>some letters and numbers</strong>.   By her fourth birthday, she’ll probably count as many as four objects and group different objects by their similar color and shape.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Accept your child’s many questions as her important efforts to learn about the world.  Try to answer simply and honestly without giving too complex  explanations.  If you do not know something, say so.  Show your child ways to find out information—for example, if she asks about birds that she sees, you may find a book or talk with a neighbor who knows all about birds.  Always offer to find the answer together in books or other sources of information.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Between the age of three and four, your child is <strong>very physically active</strong>.  You can see how much she enjoys all kinds of movements.  She has become better at running, climbing, jumping, and balancing on one leg.  She can catch a ball that’s bounced to her, most of the time.  If there are stairs in her environment, she’s better at going up them. </p>\n\n<p>In other ways, your child is becoming <strong>more independent</strong>. She eats on her own, mostly is able to dress herself, uses the toilet independently, and washes herself. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Supervise and help with parts of her personal care that are still difficult, like brushing teeth.  Watch carefully as she climbs, allowing her independence but monitoring her safety.  Give your child the opportunity to try different kinds of activities – those with a lot of movement, and those that are calmer such as drawing and looking at books.  Teach your child traditional outdoor games; dance with her and copy her movements as she can copy yours.  Support activities that your child enjoys.</p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 37th to the 48th month</strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Shows no interest in playing games with others or playing make-believe/pretend games</li>\n\t<li>Ignores other children or does not respond to people outside the family</li>\n\t<li>Can't jump in place</li>\n\t<li>Has difficulty scribbling (making marks on paper)</li>\n\t<li>Does not follow an instruction that has three parts</li>\n\t<li>Can't tell a favorite story</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>",

Now he understands jokes and riddles.  You’ll notice how many <strong>new words</strong> your child is learning every day.  He likes to use these words, but his brain sometimes works faster than he can say them—that’s all right, he’ll catch up soon. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to have conversations with your child every day.  His new experiences and interests give you a lot to talk about together.  If he struggles with how to explain or pronounce something, gently help him out without criticizing his efforts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child continues to love pretending, but now his <strong>make-believe is much more complex</strong> and dramatic.  Much of his play will be with friends, working together—for example, to make one big sand castle or a pretend house in the garden. He’ll usually be able to share his things, although he won’t always get along with his playmates.  Children may say that others are not following the rules of a game, or other conflicts may happen.  But now your child may be able to <strong>try to solve these conflicts</strong>.  Your child manages his emotions better than at earlier ages, is <strong>more patient and reasonable</strong>, and you’ll see fewer outbursts of anger or overflows of grief.  Disagreements will be fewer and more easily resolved.    </p>\n\n<p>As your child grows and his understanding of the world gets better, <strong>certain fears</strong> may arise.

He is proud of what he is able to do, but he still looks for your approval and probably still finds it difficult to bear criticism and discipline.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is now able to <strong>sustain attention to tasks</strong> for longer periods, at home or in preschool/school if he has begun preschool/school at this time.   He understands simple concepts such as time (present, future, past), knows the seasons, recognizes <strong>some letters of the alphabet</strong> and tries to read them, and can write a word such as his name.  Some children can already read at this age.  He can tell you his age, and he’s probably able to count ten objects.  As his thinking develops, you’ll see that he is able to <strong>see things from others’ points of view</strong>.  This can help him make friends (“My friend likes animals, so let’s pretend to be horses”).  He is also able to use these thinking skills to feel what another person is feeling (empathy)—“I’m sad because my father looks sad.” </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Play continues to be the most important way that your child learns new things.  Read and tell stories together to develop love of words and understanding of reading.  Let him use pencils to write or pretend-write shopping lists or letters to grandparents.  Count objects as you do everyday tasks.  Some children are beginning preschool/school at this time.  If this is your child’s first experience, it will open a whole new social world, and with it a whole set of new rules to learn. This can be challenging for your child.  He may be worried or upset; you can help by reassuring him, telling positive stories about preschool/school, and—if you see the need—sharing your concerns with your child’s teacher.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child’s <strong>movements are more coordinated</strong> now.  Depending on your environment, he may learn to ride a bike, jump over a rope, jump, and skillfully catch a ball. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it may seem to you that your child never rests - he may <strong>wiggle and fidget</strong> while watching TV, eating at the table and even while sleeping.  He has lots of energy at this age! Your child’s <strong>fine motor skills are also becoming more precise</strong> - now he can fasten shoelaces, button, zip up a comb his hair, and so on. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Within your community environment, find ways for your child to learn and practice new physical skills by himself or with friends.  You may have some traditional games that your family can teach him.  Find many ways for him to use that physical energy in safe, appropriate ways.  Encourage him to use his fine motor skills not only in dressing himself but perhaps in helping a younger brother or sister.  He will enjoy feeling important.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 61st to the 72nd month</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Has a very short attention span</li>\n\t<li>Is not at all interested in letters, numbers, reading or writing</li>\n\t<li>Seems not to hear well</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t speak clearly in sentences of 5 or more words</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t tell longer stories using complete sentences</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t dress and use toilet without help</li>\n\t<li>Can’t take part in conversations</li>\n\t<li>Can’t play in more than one way</li>\n\t<li>Can’t give his name and address</li>\n\t<li>Can’t stand or hop on one foot</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen.

            "body": "<p>A child who is not gaining weight during one or two months may need more food for a meal, more nutritious foods, or more frequent meals. The child may be ill and need more attention and care or help with meals.<br /><br /><strong>Here are some important questions to consider to help identify the causes of growth and progression problems:</strong></p>\n\n<p><br /><strong>Does the child eat often enough?</strong>  In addition to breastfeeding, a child aged 6-8 months needs 2-3 meals, and from the 9th month 3-4 meals of other foods. Additional nutritious snacks, such as a piece of fruit or bread with a healthy spread, may be needed 1-2 times a day. Children with delays or developmental disabilities sometimes need extra help and time to feed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child get enough food? </strong>A child aged 6-8 months initially needs 2-3 teaspoons of food, and the amount is gradually increased to ½ a cup (of 250 ml), for each meal at the age of 9-12 months.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the child's meals contain enough energy and nutrients?</strong> Foods that help a child's growth are beans, nuts, meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, cereals and legumes. The daily inclusion of food of animal origin is especially important. A small amount of oil can provide extra energy. Quality \"growth food\" is especially important to ensure adequate growth in weight and height. Foods such as processed fatty foods or sweet snacks are not rich in vitamins and minerals or other important nutrients and can lead to excessive weight gain without adequate growth in height.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the child get too much sweet food (cakes, cookies) or sweetened liquids (juices, teas) or other unhealthy food for meals or snacks?</strong>Reduce or replace these foods with nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, meat ,according to dietary recommendations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child get too much milk formula or other liquids (juices, teas) and not enough solid food?</strong> The fluid fills the stomach and reduces the child's need for food.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child refuse to eat? </strong>If the child does not like the taste of a certain type of food, he should be offered another. New foods should be introduced gradually.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is the child sick?</strong> A sick child should be encouraged to eat small, more frequent meals. Breastfeeding should be more frequent. After the illness, the child should eat more than usual to compensate for the lost weight, energy and nutrients. If the child is often ill, you should seek medical help for him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child get enough foods that contain vitamin A?</strong> Breast milk is rich in vitamin A. Other foods that contain it are liver, eggs, dairy products, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, and green leafy vegetables. If these foods are not available in sufficient quantities, the child should be given a supplement (tablets or syrup every 4-6 months).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child get the milk formula from the bottle?</strong> If the child is fed a milk formula, a clean cup or glass is recommended rather than a bottle with a pacifier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is food prepared and stored in a clean and safe way?</strong> If not, the child will often be ill. Raw food should be well washed or cooked, using clean water from a safe source. Cooked food should be eaten immediately; the remaining food should be carefully stored and properly reheated before eating.<br /><strong>Is the child often alone or left in the care of older children? </strong>A child needs more attention from adults, especially during meals.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Science says that the first step in quality parenting, as well as your child's sound development - is finding a way to connect with the baby.</p>\n\n<p>Connecting with the baby means responding to the baby's needs with tenderness, love and care. When you behave like this, you become special to the baby, someone he/she trusts and relies on, someone he/she calms down with, learns new skills with, learns about him/herself and the world with.</p>\n\n<p>Building a connection between you and your baby is one of the crucial aspects of development. When your baby gets what he/she needs from you: a smile, protection, cuddling, tenderness - he/she feels that he/she is safe and that the world is a safe place to learn about, play in and explore. This forms the foundation of your child's mental health, well-being and overall development during childhood and later in life.</p>\n\n<p>In order to connect with the baby, it is important, first of all, to follow - watch, listen, notice things about your baby (what he/she likes, what calms him/her, what disturbs him/her, how he/she reacts to pain, sounds...). Next, it is important to understand your baby's \"language.\" Babies usually \"speak\" by turning their eyes and head, directing their gaze or movement towards you, keeping eye contact, turning their head to the sound of your voice, making little sounds or crying, relaxed look, interested look or moving their arms and legs while in contact with you. Follow these behaviors in your child and try to respond to them.</p>\n\n<hr /><p> </p>",

            "body": "<p>For example, the baby will chatter and actively use different sounds, explore making new ones, imitate the ones you make. In addition, the baby will try to use motor skills to show you that you are important to him/her and that he/she needs your closeness, contact with you, joint activities: he/she will reach out to you, try to \"reach\" you, crawl after you. At this age, usually around the eighth month, the baby will show discomfort in contact with strangers and may strongly protest when held by or left with someone unfamiliar (to him/her). This \"fear of strangers\" is a common milestone in the child's emotional development and is another indicator that the child perceives his/her relationship with you as very important and different from all others.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what you can do to strengthen the emotional bond between you at this age:</p>\n\n<ul><li>always respond when the baby moves towards you or tries to reach you. If you can't pick up or caress him/her immediately, smile at him/her and speak to him/her gently (“You want to cuddle? Wooonderful. A hug is coming, just let me put the laundry in the washing machine”);</li>\n\t<li>name - describe in words what the baby experiences, does, feels. Repeat these words so that the baby understands their meaning (while bathing him/her, for example: \"Are you taking a bath, yes! Do you like bathing?\"). Becoming familiar with new words - names for things and phenomena - expands the vocabulary and helps the baby to actively grasp the world around him/her. The experience of understanding what your baby is feeling or doing strengthens the emotional bond between you;</li>\n\t<li>repeat the sounds the baby makes. These will now very often be syllables (eg. ma-ma-ma; ba-ba, etc.). By repeating his/her \"words\", you will encourage the baby to continue talking to you and thus improve his/her communication skills. The experience of being accepted and encouraged will strengthen your bond;</li>\n\t<li>play peekaboo with the baby. Hide your face behind your hands, and then show it to the baby again, with a smile. This will help the baby understand that you exist even when he/she cannot see you.</li>\n</ul>",

If you talk to him in everyday conversation, he will want to talk to you more.  If he sees that you enjoy talking with him, he'll begin to enjoy it too. Be patient--your child will still not be able to express himself well, so sometimes you'll need to help a bit: „Oh, is that what you played with your friend?  What else did you do?  Did you throw the ball?“ Talk about ordinary things that happen - what we do, where we have been, what we plan, what we like and what we don't. While reading books or telling stories, you can ask questions about what is happening.  Drawing and playing pretend are other ways to communicate and may support children who are sometimes unwilling to talk.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>\n\n<p>During this period, your child begins to learn how to <strong>express different feelings </strong>in an appropriate way.  He can find more and more ways to express emotions–  speech, explanation, gestures, or  play. Increasingly, he will be able to say what bothers him instead of yelling or hitting. </p>\n\n<p>During this period, children usually like to be <strong>surrounded by other people</strong>. You may see your child wanting to please his friends and wanting to be just like them.  Imaginary friends may still be an important part of your child's growing up, although real friends are the most important to him.  He is beginning to get along better and better with others.  You're likely to see him apologize, accept rules, wait for turns, and enjoy it when nice things happen to others.  Even though he can still be rather demanding or impatient, he more often <strong>cooperates and wants to help</strong> others.  At the same time, he may <strong>worry about new experiences</strong>, such as beginning preschool or playing with new children.</p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Encourage your child to be involved in various activities such as family routines, play, and socializing with other children. Share his enjoyment.  Create opportunities in which the child will feel useful and important- a little help while doing household chores, followed by praise, will encourage him to develop self-confidence. Avoid criticism, and praise the effort. If help is needed, give clear instructions and explanations.</p>\n\n<p>If he avoids trying something new or is already afraid of starting preschool, let him become familiar with the new situation and give it a try when he is ready.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Play is still a way for a child to learn about himself and about the world around him.   At this age your child will use his<strong> imagination</strong> intensively.  He will probably love to sing, dance, and pretend.  He is better able to know the difference between what is pretend and what is real.   However, at the same time he may <strong>hide the truth</strong> from his parents if he has done something he knows they do not like.  In his play, he may try <strong>different roles and behaviors</strong> - such as a doctor or a teacher.  During this period he may become more aware of his gender and gender roles.  </p>\n\n<p>Your child's learning also includes learning about his own body and other's bodies—including curiosity about boys' and girls' bodies.  Interest and curiosity about the body continues - both theirs and other people's bodies. You can find a child of this age watching his genitals or the genitals of other children with interest. </p>\n\n<p><strong> Concepts </strong>develop rapidly in this period and are foundational for later learning.  Your child in understanding more about  opposites (for example, low / high), and he can usually name quite a few <strong>letters and numbers</strong>, and print some of them.  He can correctly count objects up to 10.  His memory's getting better.  He probably remembers his address or phone number.  He may know the difference between left and right. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>In conversation and daily routines, talk about time concepts (morning, evening, today, etc. and days of the week), as well as other interesting concepts.  Use stories and children’s books to explore other concepts.  Enrich story reading or storytelling by asking your child what he thinks might happen next. Take walks around the community to explore sights and sounds that stimulate his thinking.  Create opportunities to use letters and numbers in daily activities, such as writing a note to help you remember foods to buy at the market. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is <strong>more and more physically skilled</strong> – now he can throw, catch, swing and climb, and build a tower with several small objects.  He can probably hop and perhaps even skip.  He finds it easier to <strong>dress himself</strong> now.  He's also able <strong>take care of more of his own needs</strong>.  For example, he may feed himself using a spoon or other utensils.  He may use the toilet independently and can brush his teeth wash himself without much help. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Remind him of safety rules and be sure to supervise physical activities as needed.  Create opportunities for your child to be active outdoors and teach him skills as he becomes eager to learn them.  Encourage him fine motor skills by providing simple materials for him to put together, and to draw pictures. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 49th to the 60th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period  give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Can't confidently walk, run, climb, jump or use stairs </li>\n\t<li>Can't answer simple questions (What's your name? Who is your family? What's your favorite story?)</li>\n\t<li>Can't follow a two-part direction (Put a cup on the table! Or Take the ball under the bed!) </li>\n\t<li>Can't perform daily routines such as eating or dressing on his own </li>\n\t<li>Seems to have difficulty holding a pencil</li>\n\t<li>Shows extreme behavior  (such as extremely fearful ,or aggressive, or sad)</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t talk about daily activities</li>\n\t<li>Doesn't show interest in interacting with either adults or children</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen. Be sure to limit the time in front of the screen to a maximum of one hour a day and make sure you spend every moment in front of the screen with your child to guide him through that experience. </p>",

Or Take the ball under the bed!) </li>\n\t<li>Can't perform daily routines such as eating or dressing on her own </li>\n\t<li>Seems to have difficulty holding a pencil</li>\n\t<li>Shows extreme behavior  (such as extremely fearful ,or aggressive, or sad)</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t talk about daily activities</li>\n\t<li>Doesn't show interest in interacting with either adults or children</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen. Be sure to limit the time in front of the screen to a maximum of one hour a day and make sure you spend every moment in front of the screen with your child to guide her through that experience. </p>",

            "body": "<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 37th to the 48th month</strong></h1>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>From the third to the fourth birthday is an intensive time for your child’s speech to develop.  She will learn many <strong>new words</strong> by listening to you and other adults, and also by listening to stories.  At this age, she is more interested in all kinds of communication.  She is eager to just <strong>tell you stories</strong> or describe things that happen.  You can see how much she enjoys your conversations. During this period, she will <strong>understand most of the things you say</strong> to her, and may be able to guess what some new words mean.  You will also notice that, by the end of this year, your child’s sentences will be longer.  She will also be able to follow more <strong>complex instructions </strong>with two or three parts, such as “Please close the door and come with me.”</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>As always, listen to your child and have enjoyable conversations at all times of the day.  You will find that at this age, your child has a lot to talk about!  Involve her in whatever you are doing and use this as an opportunity to playfully give her instructions or introduce interesting new words into the conversation.   Read and tell stories with your child every day.  You can ask her about the story—what does she think will happen next? </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The period from the third to the fourth birthday is very important for your child’s emotional development. During this period, she learns how <strong>to identify different emotions</strong>.  At this age, she may be able to recognize basic feelings such as happiness, sadness, fear and anger.  You might see her show some other emotions such as fear of imaginary things, concern or worry about how others behave, or love and attachment to people she feels close to.</p>\n\n<p>If she has the opportunity you will see your child making her <strong>first friends</strong> during this year.  Now she will probably begin to <strong>play more cooperatively</strong> with others, in small groups.   Sharing is becoming easier—though not always—as she has some understanding of “mine” and “hers.” </p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to create a secure environment for your child.  This makes it easier for her to express and regulate or control her feelings.  As when she was younger, predictable daily routines help create that sense of security.  Help your child know what happens next and what the typical pattern of the day will be.  If she feels safe, it will be.</p>\n\n<p>Because these first friendships are important to your child, try to create opportunities for play with other children.  But stay close to the children, because the child’s social skills at this age are still not well developed, and misunderstandings or conflicts may happen.  You will help by reacting calmly and reasonably.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play is still the dominant way in which a child of this age learns and explores herself and the world around her, but now your child’s “playful learning”  is becoming <strong>much more imaginative</strong>.  She might have a tea party or pretend to be a doctor with a sick baby.  Some children have imaginary friends at this age.  For the most part, although she loves to pretend, she knows what it real and what’s make-believe.  This is also a period of intense <strong>fascination with the world</strong> around your child.  <strong>Questions, questions, questions</strong> help her learn—who?  What?  why?  She is probably very interested in her own body and others’ bodies. </p>\n\n<p>This year your child will also develop ideas about  opposites such as big / small, and more/less, as well as  other <strong>concepts</strong> such as “on”, “in,” and “below.”  Her memory is developing, allowing her to  learn short songs and sing them later. She will also begin to point to and name <strong>some letters and numbers</strong>.   By her fourth birthday, she’ll probably count as many as four objects and group different objects by their similar color and shape.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Accept your child’s many questions as her important efforts to learn about the world.  Try to answer simply and honestly without giving too complex  explanations.  If you do not know something, say so.  Show your child ways to find out information—for example, if she asks about birds that she sees, you may find a book or talk with a neighbor who knows all about birds.  Always offer to find the answer together in books or other sources of information.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Between the age of three and four, your child is <strong>very physically active</strong>.  You can see how much she enjoys all kinds of movements.  She has become better at running, climbing, jumping, and balancing on one leg.  She can catch a ball that’s bounced to her, most of the time.  If there are stairs in her environment, she’s better at going up them. </p>\n\n<p>In other ways, your child is becoming <strong>more independent</strong>. She eats on her own, mostly is able to dress herself, uses the toilet independently, and washes herself. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Supervise and help with parts of her personal care that are still difficult, like brushing teeth.  Watch carefully as she climbs, allowing her independence but monitoring her safety.  Give your child the opportunity to try different kinds of activities – those with a lot of movement, and those that are calmer such as drawing and looking at books.  Teach your child traditional outdoor games; dance with her and copy her movements as she can copy yours.  Support activities that your child enjoys.</p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 37th to the 48th month</strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Shows no interest in playing games with others or playing make-believe/pretend games</li>\n\t<li>Ignores other children or does not respond to people outside the family</li>\n\t<li>Can't jump in place</li>\n\t<li>Has difficulty scribbling (making marks on paper)</li>\n\t<li>Does not follow an instruction that has three parts</li>\n\t<li>Can't tell a favorite story</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>",

You will now hear your child use <strong>full complex sentences.</strong>  Sometimes he can lead a conversation almost like an adult, but sometimes he still has a hard time explaining complex ideas or complex events. Now he understands jokes and riddles.  You’ll notice how many <strong>new words</strong> your child is learning every day.  He likes to use these words, but his brain sometimes works faster than he can say them—that’s all right, he’ll catch up soon. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to have conversations with your child every day.  His new experiences and interests give you a lot to talk about together.  If he struggles with how to explain or pronounce something, gently help him out without criticizing his efforts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child continues to love pretending, but now his <strong>make-believe is much more complex</strong> and dramatic.  Much of his play will be with friends, working together—for example, to make one big sand castle or a pretend house in the garden. He’ll usually be able to share his things, although he won’t always get along with his playmates.  Children may say that others are not following the rules of a game, or other conflicts may happen.  But now your child may be able to <strong>try to solve these conflicts</strong>.  Your child manages his emotions better than at earlier ages, is <strong>more patient and reasonable</strong>, and you’ll see fewer outbursts of anger or overflows of grief.  Disagreements will be fewer and more easily resolved.    </p>\n\n<p>As your child grows and his understanding of the world gets better, <strong>certain fears</strong> may arise. This age is characterized by fears of supernatural beings (ghosts), criticism, failure, physical injury or threat.</p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>During this period, your child may need your support to understand more complex feelings such as frustration or jealousy.  This is important in his understanding of some of the challenges that will come up in preschool/school and in dealing with friendships.  Stories from books or your own experience may help.</p>\n\n<p>Your child is trying hard to be independent.  You can help in encouraging him to make many small decisions (what to wear, what to eat for breakfast, etc.).  Although your child may seem to be very independent in this period, he still needs to connect with you and have your love, care and attention. He is proud of what he is able to do, but he still looks for your approval and probably still finds it difficult to bear criticism and discipline.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is now able to <strong>sustain attention to tasks</strong> for longer periods, at home or in preschool/school if he has begun preschool/school at this time.   He understands simple concepts such as time (present, future, past), knows the seasons, recognizes <strong>some letters of the alphabet</strong> and tries to read them, and can write a word such as his name.  Some children can already read at this age.  He can tell you his age, and he’s probably able to count ten objects.  As his thinking develops, you’ll see that he is able to <strong>see things from others’ points of view</strong>.  This can help him make friends (“My friend likes animals, so let’s pretend to be horses”).  He is also able to use these thinking skills to feel what another person is feeling (empathy)—“I’m sad because my father looks sad.” </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Play continues to be the most important way that your child learns new things.  Read and tell stories together to develop love of words and understanding of reading.  Let him use pencils to write or pretend-write shopping lists or letters to grandparents.  Count objects as you do everyday tasks.  Some children are beginning preschool/school at this time.  If this is your child’s first experience, it will open a whole new social world, and with it a whole set of new rules to learn. This can be challenging for your child.  He may be worried or upset; you can help by reassuring him, telling positive stories about preschool/school, and—if you see the need—sharing your concerns with your child’s teacher.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child’s <strong>movements are more coordinated</strong> now.  Depending on your environment, he may learn to ride a bike, jump over a rope, jump, and skillfully catch a ball. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it may seem to you that your child never rests - he may <strong>wiggle and fidget</strong> while watching TV, eating at the table and even while sleeping.  He has lots of energy at this age! Your child’s <strong>fine motor skills are also becoming more precise</strong> - now he can fasten shoelaces, button, zip up a comb his hair, and so on. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Within your community environment, find ways for your child to learn and practice new physical skills by himself or with friends.  You may have some traditional games that your family can teach him.  Find many ways for him to use that physical energy in safe, appropriate ways.  Encourage him to use his fine motor skills not only in dressing himself but perhaps in helping a younger brother or sister.  He will enjoy feeling important.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 61st to the 72nd month</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Has a very short attention span</li>\n\t<li>Is not at all interested in letters, numbers, reading or writing</li>\n\t<li>Seems not to hear well</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t speak clearly in sentences of 5 or more words</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t tell longer stories using complete sentences</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t dress and use toilet without help</li>\n\t<li>Can’t take part in conversations</li>\n\t<li>Can’t play in more than one way</li>\n\t<li>Can’t give his name and address</li>\n\t<li>Can’t stand or hop on one foot</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen. Be sure to limit the time in front of the screen to a maximum of one hour a day and make sure you spend every moment in front of the screen with your child to guide him through that experience. </p>\n\n<p> </p>",

            "body": "<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 61st to the 72nd month</strong></h1>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>At this age, your child probably <strong>talks a lot</strong>, with other people and even when she is alone in the room. You will now hear your child use <strong>full complex sentences.</strong>  Sometimes she can lead a conversation almost like an adult, but sometimes she still has a hard time explaining complex ideas or complex events. Now she understands jokes and riddles.  You’ll notice how many <strong>new words</strong> your child is learning every day.  She likes to use these words, but her brain sometimes works faster than she can say them—that’s all right, she’ll catch up soon. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to have conversations with your child every day.  Her new experiences and interests give you a lot to talk about together.  If she struggles with how to explain or pronounce something, gently help her out without criticizing her efforts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child continues to love pretending, but now her <strong>make-believe is much more complex</strong> and dramatic.  Much of her play will be with friends, working together—for example, to make one big sand castle or a pretend house in the garden. She’ll usually be able to share her things, although she won’t always get along with her playmates.  Children may say that others are not following the rules of a game, or other conflicts may happen.  But now your child may be able to <strong>try to solve these conflicts</strong>.  Your child manages her emotions better than at earlier ages, is <strong>more patient and reasonable</strong>, and you’ll see fewer outbursts of anger or overflows of grief.  Disagreements will be fewer and more easily resolved.    </p>\n\n<p>As your child grows and her understanding of the world gets better, <strong>certain fears</strong> may arise. This age is characterized by fears of supernatural beings (ghosts), criticism, failure, physical injury or threat.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>During this period, your child may need your support to understand more complex feelings such as frustration or jealousy.  This is important in her understanding of some of the challenges that will come up in preschool/school and in dealing with friendships.  Stories from books or your own experience may help.</p>\n\n<p>Your child is trying hard to be independent.  You can help in encouraging her to make many small decisions (what to wear, what to eat for breakfast, etc.)  Although your child may seem to be very independent in this period, she still needs to connect with you and have your love, care and attention. She is proud of what she is able to do, but she still looks for your approval and probably still finds it difficult to bear criticism and discipline.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is now able to <strong>sustain attention to tasks</strong> for longer periods, at home or in preschool/school if she has begun preschool/school at this time.   She understands simple concepts such as time (present, future, past), knows the seasons, recognizes <strong>some letters of the alphabet</strong> and tries to read them, and can write a word such as her name.  Some children can already read at this age.  She can tell you her age, and she’s probably able to count ten objects.  As her thinking develops, you’ll see that she is able to <strong>see things from others’ points of view</strong>.  This can help her make friends (“My friend likes animals, so let’s pretend to be horses”).  She is also able to use these thinking skills to feel what another person is feeling (empathy)—“I’m sad because my father looks sad.” </p>\n\n<h3> </h3>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play continues to be the most important way that your child learns new things.  Read and tell stories together to develop love of words and understanding of reading.  Let her use pencils to write or pretend-write shopping lists or letters to grandparents.  Count objects as you do everyday tasks.  Some children are beginning preschool/school at this time.  If this is your child’s first experience, it will open a whole new social world, and with it a whole set of new rules to learn. This can be challenging for your child.  She may be worried or upset; you can help by reassuring her, telling positive stories about preschool/school, and—if you see the need—sharing your concerns with your child’s teacher.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child’s <strong>movements are more coordinated</strong> now.  Depending on your environment, she may learn to ride a bike, jump over a rope, jump, and skillfully catch a ball. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it may seem to you that your child never rests - she may <strong>wiggle and fidget</strong> while watching TV, eating at the table and even while sleeping.  She has lots of energy at this age! Your child’s <strong>fine motor skills are also becoming more precise</strong>-- - now she can fasten shoelaces, button, zip up a comb her hair, and so on. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Within your community environment, find ways for your child to learn and practice new physical skills by herself or with friends.  You may have some traditional games that your family can teach her.  Find many ways for her to use that physical energy in safe, appropriate ways.  Encourage her to use her fine motor skills not only in dressing herself but perhaps in helping a younger brother or sister.  She will enjoy feeling important.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 61st to the 72nd month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Has a very short attention span</li>\n\t<li>Is not at all interested in letters, numbers, reading or writing</li>\n\t<li>Seems not to hear well</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t speak clearly in sentences of 5 or more words</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t tell longer stories using complete sentences</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t dress and use toilet without help</li>\n\t<li>Can’t take part in conversations</li>\n\t<li>Can’t play in more than one way</li>\n\t<li>Can’t give her name and address</li>\n\t<li>Can’t stand or hop on one foot</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen. Be sure to limit the time in front of the screen to a maximum of one hour a day and make sure you spend every moment in front of the screen with your child to guide her through that experience. </p>\n\n<p> </p>",

            "body": "<p>A child who is not gaining weight during one or two months may need more food for a meal, more nutritious foods, or more frequent meals. The child may be ill and need more attention and care or help with meals.<br /><br /><strong>Here are some important questions to consider to help identify the causes of growth and progression problems:</strong></p>\n\n<p><br /><strong>Does the child eat often enough?</strong>  In addition to breastfeeding, a child aged 6-8 months needs 2-3 meals, and from the 9th month 3-4 meals of other foods. Additional nutritious snacks, such as a piece of fruit or bread with a healthy spread, may be needed 1-2 times a day. Children with delays or developmental disabilities sometimes need extra help and time to feed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child get enough food? </strong>A child aged 6-8 months initially needs 2-3 teaspoons of food, and the amount is gradually increased to ½ a cup (of 250 ml), for each meal at the age of 9-12 months.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the child's meals contain enough energy and nutrients?</strong> Foods that help a child's growth are beans, nuts, meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, cereals and legumes. The daily inclusion of food of animal origin is especially important. A small amount of oil can provide extra energy. Quality \"growth food\" is especially important to ensure adequate growth in weight and height. Foods such as processed fatty foods or sweet snacks are not rich in vitamins and minerals or other important nutrients and can lead to excessive weight gain without adequate growth in height.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the child get too much sweet food (cakes, cookies) or sweetened liquids (juices, teas) or other unhealthy food for meals or snacks?</strong>Reduce or replace these foods with nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, meat ,according to dietary recommendations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child get too much milk formula or other liquids (juices, teas) and not enough solid food?</strong> The fluid fills the stomach and reduces the child's need for food.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child refuse to eat? </strong>If the child does not like the taste of a certain type of food, he should be offered another. New foods should be introduced gradually.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is the child sick?</strong> A sick child should be encouraged to eat small, more frequent meals. Breastfeeding should be more frequent. After the illness, the child should eat more than usual to compensate for the lost weight, energy and nutrients. If the child is often ill, you should seek medical help for him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child get enough foods that contain vitamin A?</strong> Breast milk is rich in vitamin A. Other foods that contain it are liver, eggs, dairy products, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, and green leafy vegetables. If these foods are not available in sufficient quantities, the child should be given a supplement (tablets or syrup every 4-6 months).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the child get the milk formula from the bottle?</strong> If the child is fed a milk formula, a clean cup or glass is recommended rather than a bottle with a pacifier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is food prepared and stored in a clean and safe way?</strong> If not, the child will often be ill. Raw food should be well washed or cooked, using clean water from a safe source. Cooked food should be eaten immediately; the remaining food should be carefully stored and properly reheated before eating.<br /><strong>Is the child often alone or left in the care of older children? </strong>A child needs more attention from adults, especially during meals.</p>",

When your baby gets what he/she needs from you: a smile, protection, cuddling, tenderness - he/she feels that he/she is safe and that the world is a safe place to learn about, play in and explore. This forms the foundation of your child's mental health, well-being and overall development during childhood and later in life.</p>\n\n<p>In order to connect with the baby, it is important, first of all, to follow - watch, listen, notice things about your baby (what he/she likes, what calms him/her, what disturbs him/her, how he/she reacts to pain, sounds...). Next, it is important to understand your baby's \"language.\" Babies usually \"speak\" by turning their eyes and head, directing their gaze or movement towards you, keeping eye contact, turning their head to the sound of your voice, making little sounds or crying, relaxed look, interested look or moving their arms and legs while in contact with you. Follow these behaviors in your child and try to respond to them.</p>\n\n<hr /><p> </p>",

            "body": "<p>For example, the baby will chatter and actively use different sounds, explore making new ones, imitate the ones you make. In addition, the baby will try to use motor skills to show you that you are important to him/her and that he/she needs your closeness, contact with you, joint activities: he/she will reach out to you, try to \"reach\" you, crawl after you. At this age, usually around the eighth month, the baby will show discomfort in contact with strangers and may strongly protest when held by or left with someone unfamiliar (to him/her). This \"fear of strangers\" is a common milestone in the child's emotional development and is another indicator that the child perceives his/her relationship with you as very important and different from all others.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what you can do to strengthen the emotional bond between you at this age:</p>\n\n<ul><li>always respond when the baby moves towards you or tries to reach you. If you can't pick up or caress him/her immediately, smile at him/her and speak to him/her gently (“You want to cuddle? Wooonderful. A hug is coming, just let me put the laundry in the washing machine”);</li>\n\t<li>name - describe in words what the baby experiences, does, feels. Repeat these words so that the baby understands their meaning (while bathing him/her, for example: \"Are you taking a bath, yes! Do you like bathing?\"). Becoming familiar with new words - names for things and phenomena - expands the vocabulary and helps the baby to actively grasp the world around him/her. The experience of understanding what your baby is feeling or doing strengthens the emotional bond between you;</li>\n\t<li>repeat the sounds the baby makes. These will now very often be syllables (eg. ma-ma-ma; ba-ba, etc.). By repeating his/her \"words\", you will encourage the baby to continue talking to you and thus improve his/her communication skills. The experience of being accepted and encouraged will strengthen your bond;</li>\n\t<li>play peekaboo with the baby. Hide your face behind your hands, and then show it to the baby again, with a smile. This will help the baby understand that you exist even when he/she cannot see you.</li>\n</ul>",
