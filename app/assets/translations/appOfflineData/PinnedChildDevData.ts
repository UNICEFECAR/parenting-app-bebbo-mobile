Although I can't see clearly as yet (except when your face is close to mine - which I really like), I can feel your gentle touch and smell your warm scent. I can hear your voice (as you talk and sing to me). I seem to recognize your voice – it is the same one that I heard while I was in your womb. I love that you are closer to me now and I want to get to know you better. I know you want to get to know me too.”",
            "body": "<h1><strong>Child development in the 1st month </strong></h1>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>During the first month of life, the baby has a big and important task of <strong>getting acquainted with the new environment</strong> in which she found herself after birth. The main way your baby communicates with you during this period is through crying. <strong>By crying, the baby sends</strong> <strong>different messages -</strong> that she is hungry, wet, tired or simply that she needs a comforting touch.  She begins to <strong>recognize sounds</strong>—especially the voices of those who care for her.  She especially likes to hear high-pitched voices, which is why both mothers and fathers naturally use a kind of “baby talk” with little ones.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>It is really important that you always respond to your baby's calls during this early period. Sometimes you might not know why your baby is crying, but even then, it is important to comfort her with your presence, voice, cuddling, stroking and gentle rocking. All this helps her feel safe. By listening to the different ways in which your baby cries, you will gradually learn what she is trying to tell you. Remember - you cannot spoil a baby by holding her in your arms, feeding her, cuddling her or talking and singing to her in a gentle voice. </p>\n\n<p>               Listen to her cry and try to understand the reason for crying. The baby may cry because she just wants your touch or because she is hungry, has some discomfort (uncomfortable body position or a wet diaper), she is sleepy, has cramps or because something else hurts. Always comfort your baby by addressing her in a warm, soothing voice, taking her in your arms, rocking and cuddling her. Do not be afraid, you will not spoil her. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby would rather <strong>look at your face</strong>, and other human faces, than anything else.  You are the center of her life.  She wants and needs to be close to you.  This is her <strong>first relationship</strong> and it is a powerful one.  She <strong>loves to be touched</strong>, but not in a way that is too quick or rough.</p>\n\n<h3> <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Because your baby is not yet able to see a lot of things at a distance, get up close to her when you can—“Here I am!  Look!” Keep physical contact with the baby as often as possible - hold her in your arms, cuddle her. Enjoy skin-to-skin contact. Talk to her, make eye contact and smile as you feed, dress or bathe her.  Help her become calm by handling her gently and soothingly, and by speaking softly to her. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Until now, your baby has been developing within the safe space of her mother's womb.  Birth is a big change for her.  Now she will <strong>learn by seeing, hearing and touching</strong>. During this period, human faces are the most interesting thing for your baby. By the end of the first month, your baby will probably be able to <strong>follow your face with her eyes</strong> if it is close enough (at about 20 to 30 cm). Things that have striking, <strong>contrasting colours</strong> - black and white or red and white, will also be very interesting for her. She may hear and recognize your voice, but sometimes she might be startled by a sudden sound and react with her whole body.  At the end of this month, your baby will be <strong>much more alert and responsive</strong> than at the time of her birth—great changes in just a few weeks!</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>The time she spends with you every day is key to her overall development and the development of her brain.  The way you respond to your baby’s needs will shape her image of the world and the people in it.  It is so simple and so important.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Even though your baby’s nervous system is still maturing, she is developing rapidly during the first month of life.  By the end of the first month, your baby may <strong>try to lift her head briefly</strong> when she is lying on her tummy or <strong>turn it to the side</strong> when she is lying on her back. This helps her to see where you are and observe the exciting world around her. Sometimes she will <strong>hold your finger</strong> firmly with her hand, but most of the time she will keep her hands in a tight fist.   She may quiver or jerk<strong> her arms</strong> and legs in movements that will become more coordinated later, and she sometimes brings her hands near her eyes and mouth. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Besides holding your baby, place her on her back to sleep for safety, and give her some very brief “tummy times” on your lap when she is not sleeping or being held.  Give her the freedom to use her arms and legs, but also try wrapping her cosily (swaddling) when she is distressed. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the 1st month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had earlier, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your baby is crying a lot, and you are not able to comfort her  </li>\n\t<li>She sucks poorly and feeds very slowly  </li>\n\t<li>She sleeps more than expected (more than 16 hours a day), or she does not sleep peacefully  </li>\n\t<li>She is not moving her arms or legs at all  </li>\n\t<li>She does not startle when a loud noise is made </li>\n\t<li>She does not blink at bright lights.</li>\n</ul>",

            "body": "<h1><strong>Child development during the 2nd month   </strong></h1>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>The first thing you may notice during this period is that your <strong>baby</strong><strong> </strong><strong>cries more </strong>than she used to in the first days after birth. This is expected during the second month of development, and it will continue during the third month.  It actually means that your baby is learning to communicate with you. Her <strong>cries are more distinct</strong> now—different cries to indicate her hunger, discomfort, or tiredness.   You will also begin to notice that she is making <strong>cooing sounds</strong> (may be “ooh” or “aah”) and gurgles. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>\n\n<p> It will take her a while to make sure you understand the way she communicates, so it is important to respond to your baby’s cry every time.  Speak to your baby clearly and slowly when your baby makes a sound, express joy with your facial expressions and voice and repeat her sounds. </p>\n\n<p>              </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby has <strong>developed a relationship</strong> with you and recognizes you - mostly by your smell and voice.  She tries to look for you and other special people.  During this period, she may already respond to you with her first <strong>smile</strong>—a magical moment.  </p>\n\n<p>She will generally become more sensitive to sounds during the second month - not only will she recognise you when you speak to her, but she will also <strong>respond to your voice</strong> by looking for your face when you talk to her.  She still needs your comfort, of course, but she is becoming able to <strong>comfort herself</strong>, for example by putting her fist in her mouth. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Whenever you respond by satisfying your baby's need - feeding her, changing her wet clothes, or  reaching out to her with your voice and touch - she will feel comforted and safe.  Always soothe your baby by speaking in a soft voice, gentle touching, rocking or singing. Your baby likes to be near you. She likes to look around and listen.  Rock her, sing and talk to her,  use baby talk, and play with her often. Pay attention to what pleases her and what soothes her.  Help her learn to calm herself—it is fine for her to suck on her fingers. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>She is <strong>learning a lot through her eyes</strong> – for example, she follows interesting objects with her eyes.  She is <strong>curious about faces</strong> she sees, which are another source of new information for your baby.   She may start being<strong> bored</strong> and fussy if an activity does not change, or <strong>overstimulated</strong> if there is too much change.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>When your baby is on her tummy, you can put a toy with bright colours in front of her and move it from one side to the other. If your baby starts complaining, turning her head to the side or crying during playing, it can be a sign of excessive stimulation. You may need to slow down the play a little or take a break.  However, you can also observe whether perhaps she is a bit bored and will enjoy a new activity or just being carried to a different part of the room.  You know your baby best!  You can offer your baby different things that she can look at, touch and hold in her hand. When she is lying on her back, hold a toy or rattle above her head, at eye level, and encourage her to reach for it.  This is a new and interesting problem for her to solve.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>By the end of the second month,  your baby’s motor skills become better and better.   Children develop on different timelines, but during this period, she will probably be able to<strong> </strong><strong>lift</strong><strong> </strong><strong>her</strong><strong> </strong><strong>head and move</strong> it from side to side when she is on her tummy.  Her <strong>arm and leg movements are smoother</strong> and more coordinated than when she was a newborn.  It is interesting for her to discover her body, so <strong>her</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hands and fingers</strong> will probably be the most amusing for her in this period. For example, she will explore her hands by looking at them, putting them together and separating them, and with your help, she will be able to <strong>hold an object</strong> in her hands.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>\n\n<p> Put your baby on her tummy when she is awake, with interesting, safe objects near her.  Stroke and massage your baby - you will encourage her motor development.  At the same time, you will bond with her and be able to comfort her if she is distressed.  </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development during the 2nd month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>the baby frequently cries a lot, and you are not usually able to soothe her   </li>\n\t<li>she isn’t watching faces even for a short time   </li>\n\t<li>she isn’t responding to bright light or loud sounds   </li>\n\t<li>she isn’t feeding or sleeping well (or sleeps more than 16 hours a day)   </li>\n\t<li>she isn’t moving her arms or legs at all</li>\n\t<li>she isn`t bringing her hands to her mouth   </li>\n\t<li>she isn’t smiling at people.  </li>\n</ul>",

Although crying is still her most important signal, the period of intense crying will slowly come to an end, because your baby will now try to communicate with you in different ways. For example, you will see her <strong>smile,</strong> or even give a loud <strong>laugh</strong>, when she sees or experiences something that she likes.  She will often try to respond to you by <strong>cooing</strong> or making a vowel sound like “aaaah”!  She loves making sounds, so you may also hear her babble when you leave her alone.  Sometimes she even copies sounds that she hears.  She is really communicating now!</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>               When you hold and talk happily to her, she will listen carefully, and sometimes try to repeat your voice sounds.   So do this often.  Talk to your baby, and be sure to listen to her response.  When she makes sounds, show her that you are happy and excited to hear them.  She will also enjoy hearing you copy some of her babbling sounds.  Make time in your day for quiet play times when you sing to your baby, tell her a story, or show a book to her.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby continues to be <strong>fascinated by faces</strong>.  She can observe them carefully and for a long time.  She is so interested in you—she <strong>may copy your smile</strong> and even a frown.

As your baby is using her hands and fingers more, you may find her staring at her hands in admiration and often using them as her first very fun toys.  During this period, she is also <strong>learning by looking</strong>.  Her eyes follow moving objects.  Of course she loves faces but she is also learning by watching them.  She begins to recognize people, and also familiar objects, not just when they are up close, but now when they are further away.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Allow her to explore by giving her the possibility to grasp safe objects of different shapes, textures and colours.  Let her enjoy them with both the sense of touch and the sense of taste.  Put interesting objects in her hands and help her to hold them.  Play games like peek-a-boo. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>During the third and fourth month, you will notice that your baby can better <strong>control the movements of her head.</strong> She does not need as much support for her head when you hold her in your arms or put her down. Your baby is <strong>exploring possible ways of moving</strong>. When you put her on her tummy, she may be able to raise her head and support herself with her arms.  She <strong>may also be able to roll over</strong> from her tummy to her back.  She can now not just hold a toy or other object, but she can also <strong>shake an object and swing at an object</strong> that is dangled in front of her.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Give your baby many opportunities to use her body in different ways.  Get down on the floor with her for some play times.  Find simple everyday objects that she can hold and explore.   Your baby needs to explore with her mouth, but only with safe objects.  Be especially careful about small things that could cause choking. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 3rd to the 4th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your baby frequently cries a lot and cannot be comforted  </li>\n\t<li>she isn’t making eye contact or paying attention to people's faces  </li>\n\t<li>she doesn’t watch things as they move  </li>\n\t<li>she isn’t making any sounds or responding to sounds  </li>\n\t<li>she can’t hold her head steady </li>\n\t<li>she isn’t reaching for a toy or object that is in front of her</li>\n\t<li>she doesn’t bring things to her mouth. </li>\n</ul>",

Encourage her with a smile or by repeating the sounds she made, so that you help the conversation between you last as long as possible. </p>\n\n<p>Talk to your child every day.  Encourage communication in many ways--sing to her,  look with her at pictures in magazines, point to things in shop windows and describe them, read aloud simple books or tell her stories and make interesting sounds (the cat says “miaow,” the cow says “moooo”!). When your baby looks at something, talk about what she sees.  Say things to your child as you prepare for breastfeeding or as you prepare a meal (“Now I’m getting your fruit”); that’s one way that she will learn to wait a little and be patient.  Words help in many ways!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In this period, most babies begin to <strong>recognize familiar persons</strong>, such as parents, other close family members, and familiar child care providers, and enjoy interacting with them.  Your baby is learning to rely on these special people for comfort and help. She knows who is familiar and who is a stranger-- <strong>she may even show fear of new people</strong>.  Your baby will be able to <strong>use sounds to clearly express feelings</strong>.  She shows her joy and happiness by squealing or making other delighted sounds.  And she is able to use sounds to show intense dissatisfaction, anger or indignation. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby needs your emotional support.  Therefore, it is important that you are there for her, especially when there are strangers around. Stay close to her, hold her in your arms, smile at her and talk to her in a soothing voice as you introduce her to new people. That way, she will feel safe and secure to make new contacts.  Interpret your child's moods. When she is happy, continue with the activity. If she is upset, take a break and comfort her.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>               </em></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Her intensive exploration is helping her develop her thinking skills.  She is <strong>looking curiously at objects</strong> and scenes in her environment.  If something is out of her reach, she tries to <strong>reach</strong> for it so that she can explore even more.  She is probably starting to <strong>move things from one hand into another</strong>, and to explore objects with her <strong>mouth</strong>. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby will find many ways to explore on her own, but you can also show her different, interesting ways to use toys or other objects:  moving them from hand to hand, shaking, banging, pushing, and throwing.  Be aware of safety, especially when your baby is exploring with her mouth.  You might also try active games in front of a mirror for some new perspectives! </p>\n\n<p>When your baby drops an object, pick it up and return it to her.  This helps her learn about cause and effect (“if I do this, that happens), and about how to think about the space around her.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In this period, your baby is probably able to <strong>lift and hold her head</strong> on her own.  She will probably manage to be in a <strong>sitting position</strong> for some time while you support her and maybe even on her own.  She will <strong>roll from one side to the other</strong>.  All of this gives your baby a whole new perspective on the world--now she can see things that she could not see while lying on her back.  Because she can now change her position, she becomes interested and <strong>curious about more and more things</strong> around her.  She <strong>looks carefully at objects</strong> that surround her, following them closely with her eyes if they move. During this period, she will also develop the skill of <strong>reaching for objects</strong>, and once she grasps them, she will enjoy exploring them by putting them in her mouth or passing them from one hand to the other hand.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play on the floor with your baby every day.  Every day, during your regular routines, give your baby a lot of opportunities to explore the environment and interesting objects around her.  Let her see the environment in different ways by putting her in different positions.   You can place your child's favourite object a little out of reach, and you can encourage her to get to it. Think about what safe, simple objects she can explore.  What can she pick up, touch, and turn over?  All of this is developing her movement skills and opening new opportunities to explore the world.   <strong>             </strong></p>\n\n<p>               To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 5th to the 6th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your baby regularly cries for a long time and cannot be comforted  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t making eye contact with you or isn’t following moving objects with her eyes  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>isn’t babbling or turning towards the source of a sound  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t laughing or making squealing sounds  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t rolling over  </li>\n\t<li>has no control over her neck and head  </li>\n\t<li>cannot sit even with your help and support or  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>isn’t reaching for objects at all even when you encourage her to do so</li>\n\t<li>doesn’t try to get things that are within reach</li>\n\t<li>has difficulty getting things to her mouth. </li>\n</ul>",

            "body": "<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 7th to the 9th month </strong></h1>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>From the 7th to the 9th month, your baby will babble most of the time.  Her babbling can sound like real talking, using the rhythms of speech even though you cannot understand the words.  In this period, some babies will already say their first word, probably sounding like “ma-ma” or “da-da”, even though the baby will still not know its exact meaning.  At this age your baby will show that she understands some other words – for example, when you say,  “Where is mama?” or “Where is your papa?” she may look around for her mother or her father.  Or she might stop what she is doing when she hears the word “no.”    </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Talk with your baby as you go about your ordinary daily routines.  She loves to hear you talk with her.  It is easy:  just tell her what you are doing, what you’re going to do, or name the objects that you’re using or that are around her.  This helps your baby connect things with their names and meanings. When your baby babbles, respond warmly.  For example, if she babbles “ah-ah-ah” as she looks at fruit in the kitchen, you might copy her sounds and also say “Oh, do you see the apples?  See, here’s an apple!”    Besides talking with her, also sing, play songs, tell stories and read to her, every day.  This shows her how much you love her and helps her learn how to communicate.</p>\n\n<p>              </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>At this age, even without words your baby will be able to let you know, very clearly, when she is happy or upset. These months are a time when your baby is developing a strong bond or attachment to you or close family members or caregivers.  But at the same time, she’s developing a fear of new people.  If a friendly neighbour comes to visit, your baby might hide or cry—even if she went happily to the person a few months before.  She is probably quite definite about who her favourite people are and will look for their attention and help.  She will use her new physical skills to move close to you or another special person, smile, and expect you to respond.  If you leave the room even briefly, she may get upset.   If she is upset about that or other things, she will look for a comforting cuddle. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Remember, these are normal, typical behaviours at this age—and they show that she knows who are the important people in her world and how much she cares about you.   Even though it is hard sometimes, be patient and provide your baby with a sense of security when she meets new people.  Pay attention to how your baby reacts to new situations and people, as her reactions will probably change from week to week.  If new people become part of her world, try to help her get used to them gradually, so that she  feels comfortable.  Name the feelings you notice in your child—“Yes, I see that you are feeling scared.  It will be all right; I’m here.  Let’s see if we can help you feel better.” </p>\n\n<p>If you need to spend time away from your baby on a regular basis, for example, if she attends a child care program, make sure that your baby has some of her favourite things with her and is familiar with the care provider.  If possible, choose a setting in which she will be with the same care provider every day. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Because your baby is beginning to crawl and perhaps even stand with help, a whole new part of the world opens up to her. When she reaches interesting objects, she is now able to pick them up with a precise grip and   inspect them very carefully.  If you hide an object with a cloth, she looks for where she saw it last.  She can look for a toy that you cover with a piece of cloth.  If she throws something, she watches it and looks for the place where it fell.  </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play games like peek-a-boo or a “hiding and finding” game—perhaps you put a small toy under a blanket and encourage your baby to pull the blanket to discover the toy.  She will love to repeat these kinds of games, that build thinking skills as well as emotional security.  She will also love to drop small objects into a bowl, take them out again, and do this ever and over.  (Do watch closely, as babies at this age also explore by putting objects in their mouth.)   Let her play with small objects, pushing them around, or rolling balls back and forth.  As she plays, she begins to understand that her actions can make certain things happen (cause/effect)—an important discovery. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>These months bring some exciting developments.  In this period, your baby develops many new motor skills that allow her to discover the charms of the world around her.  Each child develops on an individual timetable, but most likely she is now beginning not only to sit independently but also to move, most often by crawling or rolling.  She is also more and more successful in holding small objects with her fingers.  She skilfully examines objects with her hands, often passing items from one hand to another-- although she will still very often explore objects by putting them in her mouth.  In these areas and in others, your baby’s independence is growing.   In this period and depending on your traditions, you may be introducing your baby to solid foods.  </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Place your baby next to interesting objects that she can pick up safely. Allow your child to move around the room freely as long as the environment is safe and you are nearby to supervise and help if needed.  Make sure that none of the objects your baby handles are too small, to prevent the risk of choking.  Your task is to provide the baby with an environment that is stimulating enough so that she can explore, but also safe enough so that she does not get hurt.  When she discovers something, share her discovery with a big smile or comment (“Look what you found—a cup!  May I see it?”).  In this way, the baby will learn to develop her curiosity and feel safe and protected at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>If she is beginning to eat solid food, allow her to explore different tastes and explore new foods in different ways.  Most children at this age will try to eat on their own (by picking up pieces of food and feeding themselves). </p>\n\n<p>               To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 7th to the 9th month</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>If your baby isn’t making eye contact with you or isn’t following moving objects with her eyes  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>Isn’t babbling (“mama,” “dada,” etc.)  </li>\n\t<li>Isn’t turning her head towards a sound source  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t look where you point</li>\n\t<li>doesn’t show affection for her caregivers – doesn’t smile at them  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t respond to her own name</li>\n\t<li>doesn’t seem to recognize familiar people</li>\n\t<li>isn’t rolling  </li>\n\t<li>when you lift her, she is either floppy or too stiff  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>she can’t sit even with your help and support  </li>\n\t<li>and has difficulties eating solid food.  </li>\n</ul>",

Although she will still mostly babble, by the end of the first year your baby will probably use and understand at least one word (such as “ma-ma” or “da-da”). She will <strong>try to communicate</strong> intensively with you in every way she can - not only using words, but also by pointing, moving, nodding, waving... If your baby doesn`t use words yet, do not worry. She will find other way to attract your attention and let you know what she wants. She will understand you more and more.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Talk to your baby during daily rituals - dressing, feeding, walking, shopping… Just name what you do or what you see around you—it’s not a lesson, just a conversation!  If she tries to talk, give her sounds meaning by adding a bit (for example, when she says \"da-da\" or “ma-ma” you could respond \"Yes, Dad has come\" or “Yes, Mummy has come”). By doing this, you’re enriching her vocabulary and building her communication skills.</p>\n\n<p>During this period, you may notice that she <strong>understands short instructions</strong> such as \"give it to your brother\", \"wave bye-bye\" or \"don’t touch it.\"  Recognize her new understanding by giving her a big smile or praise.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>As when she was younger, your baby will probably still show some <strong>stranger anxiety.  </strong>She may still be <strong>scared and start to cry</strong> when you <strong>leave</strong> the room. As her emotional development progresses, she will become more and more <strong>aware</strong> of her <strong>needs</strong>.  And as she becomes better at communicating, she’ll be able to let you know her desires and feelings.</p>\n\n<h3>            <strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to reassure your baby if she avoids new people.  Give her everyday experiences in which you may leave briefly—even to get a toy from another room—and come back.  Games like hide-and-seek or peek-a-boo give practice in managing these feelings, too.  Whatever her feelings, listen and try to interpret her wishes and put those feelings into words for her (for example, “Oh, baby is so tired” or “Baby wants that spoon; let me get it for you.”)</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New? </strong></h3>\n\n<p>Remember that your baby is in the process of <strong>learning</strong> all the time during this period.  Babies of this age love to find hidden objects under a blanket or a cup.  She also wants to discover how objects work - often by grabbing, shaking, hitting, throwing, or banging something on the ground (be sure objects are safe!). ... she will enjoy playing with the adults who look after her.  At the end of the first year she may also initiate the play - by showing you the toys with which she is playing.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Just as when she was younger, your baby will still learn best <strong>through play</strong>.  In <strong>Playing Together</strong> section, you’ll find many activities that your baby will love at this age.  Every child is unique, so follow her initiative and support her choice of toys and interests.  Simple everyday objects and activities will enrich her knowledge and thinking abilities. Read books, tell traditional stories, play music or sing songs, and recite nursery rhymes for her.  Let her turn over the pages of picture books.  Bathing or getting dressed are great times to help her point to body parts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>These months bring some exciting developments.  Most likely, your baby will begin by  <strong>standing by holding onto something.  </strong>Then she may try <strong>standing independently </strong>and perhaps take to her <strong>first steps</strong>. Every child is different, but by the end of this period some babies may even <strong>walk on their own.  </strong>However, walking is a big challenge for babies, and some early walkers will still go back to crawling as an easier way to explore their world.  At the same time, she is becoming more skilled at using her hands and fingers to explore her environment.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>You don’t need to teach a child to walk!  But do find fun, everyday ways to encourage her to move, so that she will build muscle strength for more complex movements.   Now that you have her on the go, check that your home is safe and secure for the little adventurer.  Her coordination and use of her hands are improving, too.  You can help by encouraging her to explore different textures of objects with her touch, or to bang one object against another, or to put them into boxes and take them out of them, or to gather food crumbs from the table. Give her crayons to scribble on paper.</p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 10th to the 12th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones</strong>) expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>your child isn`t making eye contact with you or isn’t following moving objects with her eyes</li>\n\t<li>is not interested in sounds</li>\n\t<li>does not respond to her name when you call her</li>\n\t<li>isn’t babbling</li>\n\t<li>isn’t trying to let you know in any way what her desires or needs are</li>\n\t<li>isn’t pointing to objects</li>\n\t<li>isn’t showing emotions</li>\n\t<li>isn’t crawling</li>\n</ul>",

I’m exploring because I know my parents are around and I feel safe. When I need help or if something seems interesting to me, I point with my hand, or I might say a word or two.  It is very important for me that you notice what I am pointing at and tell me what it is called.  I really like learning new words.  I don’t understand all the words right now, but I will learn their meaning by hearing you say them every day.”",

If she gets briefly separated from these special adults, you will probably see—and hear--her become very upset.   You do not need to worry about this reaction; it is typical of most children at this age, and actually shows her deep attachment to you.  Other emotions begin to show themselves in this period.  For example, shame may appear in reaction to seeing others’ displeasure at something your baby has done.  She may also begin to show defiance if she has been told not to do something she wants to do. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Give your baby patient, loving attention when she follows directions or tries to manage difficult situations. Encourage her with approval, praise, reassurance, kisses and cuddling for her appropriate, desired behaviours. This will help her, gradually, learn what is expected of her.  If she is upset when you leave her, even briefly, reassure her, accept her emotions, and remind her that you always come back.  Continue to name her feelings and reflect them back to her:  “I know you are really sad because you cannot go outside now.  We will read a story and get ready for your nap now, and we will play outside later.” </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby is just beginning to group things that are the same shape or colour.   She also is learning to follow simple instructions, if they have only one or two steps (“Here are your shoes and give them to me so we can go outside.” Her exploration becomes even more intense—she is interested in how all kinds of things work. </p>\n\n<p>By the time your baby is 18 months old, you are likely to see “pretend play” appear.  She might pretend to talk on the phone or eat make-believe food, or feed a pretend animal.  Whatever she sees in her environment gives her ideas for pretend play.  All of this strengthens her ability to think creatively and to understand more about the world.  Your baby may also learn through being with other children, even if it is still just watching them as they play side by side. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Because your baby wants to understand what she can do with different things, she will probably enjoy games such as finding a hidden object, pointing to body parts or familiar objects already known to her. The games will be more fun and lead to even more learning if you take turns (me and then you).  For example, this could be throwing a ball, turning pages in a book (one page for me, one page for you), showing different objects (this one for me and this one for you) or games imitating everyday actions.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In this period, your child may be able to stand alone without help and without holding on to something.  Many children take their first steps in this period.  Children of the same age develop differently, but during this period, some children already start running, climbing furniture, or walking up and down stairs if these are in a child’s environment.   Skills like these help your baby become more independent and give her more ways to actively explore the world in which she lives. </p>\n\n<p>During this period, your baby will find it easier than before to use her hands skilfully for many things.  These might include scribbling with a pencil, turning pages in a book or magazine, using a spoon, holding a cup while drinking, or stacking up objects to make a simple tower. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Everyday activities will be the best way to give your baby opportunities to practice her developing physical skills.  If possible, take her outdoors for active play with you—watching her closely for safety.  Ask her to help you do things like opening doors or carrying small items (if she is walking).  Get involved in her activities!  Sing songs together, especially those that have accompanying movements (e.g. singing and touching head, shoulders, knees and toes).  You may know traditional songs and games to teach your baby.</p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 13th to the 18th month</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>that your child has difficulty seeing or hearing some things  </li>\n\t<li>does not say a single word  </li>\n\t<li>finds it difficult to follow even straightforward instructions  </li>\n\t<li>does not use gestures and pointing in communication  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>doesn’t make eye contact with you and does not cuddle  </li>\n\t<li>isn`t walking independently by herself.  </li>\n</ul>",

Play animal sound games. Sing nursery rhymes together.  </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>At this age, your child begins to experience more complex feelings-- anger or frustration, guilt, shame, or intense excitement.  These kinds of feelings can be hard for her to deal with. As a result, at this age children often experience a kind of explosion of feelings (a temper tantrum). Children handle intense feelings in different ways, but some may react by crying, screaming, kicking, falling down, or even running out of the room or vomiting. </p>\n\n<p> At this period of development, your child begins to be able to communicate her feelings in simple language and gestures.  She may recognize and even say that \"she is sad\" or hug and kiss you, to show comfort and reassurance. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, social and emotional skills are growing.  If she has a chance, she probably enjoys being near other children and playing beside them (although probably not interacting or cooperating in their play just yet).   </p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Describe the feelings that the child expresses or encounters in everyday life or stories.  Try to prevent tantrums through distraction, calming activities, or other ways of soothing her.  Praise positive behaviour more than depending mainly on punishment.  Praise means a lot to her.  If tantrums occur, try to stay calm, protect her from harm, and help her learn how to regain control.</p>\n\n<p>Build her emotional security by asking your child to help you—for example by bringing you something, putting a toy back in its place, turning the page of the book you are looking at together, or helping with simple household chores.  At the same time, she is learning to communicate, reason, and develop physical skills. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>You will notice that your child is beginning to be able to follow a simple direction, perhaps one with two steps (“Pick up your toy and bring to mom (or dad), please”).  She enjoys finding things that are hidden and remembers where objects were before.  She also begins to put objects in groups, such as items that are the same colour or shape.  </p>\n\n<p>You will see your child get more and more involved in \"pretend play.\"  At first, she may just pretend to eat or drink.  As time goes on, her make-believe becomes even more complex—perhaps she pretends that a piece of cloth is a baby that she hugs, pats, and feeds!  Creative thinking and problem solving are developed through this kind of play. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p> Everyday activities help her learn these and other skills.  As you go through your day, ask her simple questions and show enjoyment of her answers.  She can learn body parts as you bathe, comb hair, and dress.  Teach her to name body parts, animals and things for everyday use. Play animal sound games. Sing nursery rhymes together.   Remember that play continues to be the most important way for her to learn.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>By this age, your child will most likely walk independently.  This is exciting for her and for you!  She will also begin to explore and increase her skills in other kinds of movement, such as running and kicking a ball. Depending on the environment, these may also include walking up and downstairs or climbing onto or down from furniture.</p>\n\n<p>You may also see her independence in wanting to dress or undress herself, or to do other things that are new and physically challenging.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>At this age, your child needs a responsible adult nearby while she is playing actively, running, or jumping.   Help her with new physical challenges like getting down from furniture or holding on while climbing stairs.  Keeping your eye on her actions, you will encourage her to try out new ways of moving while you also give her a sense of safety and security. </p>\n\n<p>You can encourage independence in dressing by making it easier for her.  At the beginning, children find it easier to undress than to get dressed (as you often see at inconvenient times!).  At nap- or bedtime, encourage her to participate by taking off socks, shoes, or clothes that do not require unbuttoning<strong>. </strong></p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<h2> </h2>\n\n<h2><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 19th to the 24th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones) </strong>expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Doesn’t look at you (eye contact)</li>\n\t<li>has  difficulties seeing or hearing certain things  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t say a single word  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t point to objects  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t follow simple instructions  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>doesn’t show feelings  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t walking steadily  </li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n",

At this age, most children can compose <strong>sentences</strong> of 2 to 5 words, and it is easier to understand what your child is saying to you.  She will slowly learn how to listen and wait for her turn and will be able to keep up a <strong>short conversation</strong>.  During this period, your child learns how to <strong>describe things</strong> that have happened during the day.  With a little help from you, she can even begin to tell a simple story in sequence.  How exciting for her and for you! </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>               Establish a shared reading time with your child and allow her to turn the pages of a picture book by herself. Teach your child simple songs and rhymes, perhaps from your own childhood or traditions. Ask your child to show you things in pictures and encourage her to repeat the words after you, even if it doesn’t sound much like your pronunciation.  Your child will be interested in the names of things.  Try to not just say the name, but some descriptive words (like \"yes, it’s a big blue truck,” or “Ball—the ball is big, isn’t it?”). </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>This is a <strong>very important period for your child`s emotional development</strong>. Your child experiences lots of feelings every day—from intense happiness to sadness, frustration, and, sometimes, anger.  At the same time, she is learning about <strong>other people`s feelings</strong>, including the <strong>beginnings of empathy</strong>--feeling the way someone else may be feeling.   As when she was younger, she still may have some angry outbursts or temper tantrums.  She still has a <strong>hard time putting big feelings into words</strong>.  During this period, your child will also begin to understand how her behavior affects yours, and also how your behavior affects her.  Now she is apt to be less worried about <strong>separating </strong>from you, although it may still be hard at times, and every child is different. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Talk with your child about feelings, tell stories or read age-appropriate books about all kinds of emotions.  Encourage her to make believe about emotions with her toys or other objects.  Accept that she still cannot manage her big feelings sometimes and use your calmness to create a secure environment for her.  And playing, especially make-believe play, is a wonderful way for her to understand and cope with feelings.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is slowly beginning to understand <strong>important ideas like time</strong> (such as day and night, before and after) <strong>and opposites</strong> (big and small).  Also, in this period, she will probably show you that she understands the <strong>purposes of different parts of her body</strong> (“I see with my eyes”).  She begins to try <strong>grouping   objects</strong> by colour, size or shape. She will also start <strong>solving simple problems through trial and error</strong>—“If the spoon doesn’t fit in the jar, maybe I can try a smaller one.”</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Remember that your child continues to learn best through exploration and play.  New concepts can be explored by using objects and by playing pretend.  Encourage your child to play lots of “pretend games” and sometimes join in the game your child is leading.  Continue to involve her in everyday experiences that let you explore together and try out new things:  “Let’s plant some flowers today!”  or “Can you find a good place to put those cups? Thank you!”</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is becoming <strong>much more independent</strong>. During this period, your child can get dressed and undressed on her own—not perfectly, of course-- wash her hands or eat by herself. An important aspect of becoming independent is the use of the toilet.  In many cultures and families, this typically begins during this time.

During this period, she will <strong>understand most of the things you say</strong> to her, and may be able to guess what some new words mean.  You will also notice that, by the end of this year, your child’s sentences will be longer.  She will also be able to follow more <strong>complex instructions </strong>with two or three parts, such as “Please close the door and come with me.”</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>As always, listen to your child and have enjoyable conversations at all times of the day.  You will find that at this age, your child has a lot to talk about!  Involve her in whatever you are doing and use this as an opportunity to playfully give her instructions or introduce interesting new words into the conversation.   Read and tell stories with your child every day.  You can ask her about the story—what does she think will happen next? </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The period from the third to the fourth birthday is very important for your child’s emotional development. During this period, she learns how <strong>to identify different emotions</strong>.  At this age, she may be able to recognize basic feelings such as happiness, sadness, fear and anger.  You might see her show some other emotions such as fear of imaginary things, concern or worry about how others behave, or love and attachment to people she feels close to.</p>\n\n<p>If she has the opportunity you will see your child making her <strong>first friends</strong> during this year.  Now she will probably begin to <strong>play more cooperatively</strong> with others, in small groups.   Sharing is becoming easier—though not always—as she has some understanding of “mine” and “hers.” </p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to create a secure environment for your child.  This makes it easier for her to express and regulate or control her feelings.  As when she was younger, predictable daily routines help create that sense of security.  Help your child know what happens next and what the typical pattern of the day will be.  If she feels safe, it will be.</p>\n\n<p>Because these first friendships are important to your child, try to create opportunities for play with other children.  But stay close to the children, because the child’s social skills at this age are still not well developed, and misunderstandings or conflicts may happen.  You will help by reacting calmly and reasonably.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play is still the dominant way in which a child of this age learns and explores herself and the world around her, but now your child’s “playful learning”  is becoming <strong>much more imaginative</strong>.  She might have a tea party or pretend to be a doctor with a sick baby.  Some children have imaginary friends at this age.  For the most part, although she loves to pretend, she knows what it real and what’s make-believe.  This is also a period of intense <strong>fascination with the world</strong> around your child.  <strong>Questions, questions, questions</strong> help her learn—who?  What?  why?  She is probably very interested in her own body and others’ bodies. </p>\n\n<p>This year your child will also develop ideas about  opposites such as big / small, and more/less, as well as  other <strong>concepts</strong> such as “on”, “in,” and “below.”  Her memory is developing, allowing her to  learn short songs and sing them later. She will also begin to point to and name <strong>some letters and numbers</strong>.   By her fourth birthday, she’ll probably count as many as four objects and group different objects by their similar color and shape.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Accept your child’s many questions as her important efforts to learn about the world.  Try to answer simply and honestly without giving too complex  explanations.  If you do not know something, say so.  Show your child ways to find out information—for example, if she asks about birds that she sees, you may find a book or talk with a neighbor who knows all about birds.  Always offer to find the answer together in books or other sources of information.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Between the age of three and four, your child is <strong>very physically active</strong>.  You can see how much she enjoys all kinds of movements.  She has become better at running, climbing, jumping, and balancing on one leg.  She can catch a ball that’s bounced to her, most of the time.  If there are stairs in her environment, she’s better at going up them. </p>\n\n<p>In other ways, your child is becoming <strong>more independent</strong>. She eats on her own, mostly is able to dress herself, uses the toilet independently, and washes herself. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Supervise and help with parts of her personal care that are still difficult, like brushing teeth.  Watch carefully as she climbs, allowing her independence but monitoring her safety.  Give your child the opportunity to try different kinds of activities – those with a lot of movement, and those that are calmer such as drawing and looking at books.  Teach your child traditional outdoor games; dance with her and copy her movements as she can copy yours.  Support activities that your child enjoys.</p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 37th to the 48th month</strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Shows no interest in playing games with others or playing make-believe/pretend games</li>\n\t<li>Ignores other children or does not respond to people outside the family</li>\n\t<li>Can't jump in place</li>\n\t<li>Has difficulty scribbling (making marks on paper)</li>\n\t<li>Does not follow an instruction that has three parts</li>\n\t<li>Can't tell a favorite story</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n",

You will now hear your child use <strong>full complex sentences.</strong>  Sometimes she can lead a conversation almost like an adult, but sometimes she still has a hard time explaining complex ideas or complex events. Now she understands jokes and riddles.  You’ll notice how many <strong>new words</strong> your child is learning every day.  She likes to use these words, but her brain sometimes works faster than she can say them—that’s all right, she’ll catch up soon. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to have conversations with your child every day.  Her new experiences and interests give you a lot to talk about together.  If she struggles with how to explain or pronounce something, gently help her out without criticizing her efforts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child continues to love pretending, but now her <strong>make-believe is much more complex</strong> and dramatic.  Much of her play will be with friends, working together—for example, to make one big sand castle or a pretend house in the garden. She’ll usually be able to share her things, although she won’t always get along with her playmates.  Children may say that others are not following the rules of a game, or other conflicts may happen.  But now your child may be able to <strong>try to solve these conflicts</strong>.  Your child manages her emotions better than at earlier ages, is <strong>more patient and reasonable</strong>, and you’ll see fewer outbursts of anger or overflows of grief.  Disagreements will be fewer and more easily resolved.    </p>\n\n<p>As your child grows and her understanding of the world gets better, <strong>certain fears</strong> may arise. This age is characterized by fears of supernatural beings (ghosts), criticism, failure, physical injury or threat.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>During this period, your child may need your support to understand more complex feelings such as frustration or jealousy.  This is important in her understanding of some of the challenges that will come up in preschool/school and in dealing with friendships.  Stories from books or your own experience may help.</p>\n\n<p>Your child is trying hard to be independent.  You can help in encouraging her to make many small decisions (what to wear, what to eat for breakfast, etc.)  Although your child may seem to be very independent in this period, she still needs to connect with you and have your love, care and attention. She is proud of what she is able to do, but she still looks for your approval and probably still finds it difficult to bear criticism and discipline.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is now able to <strong>sustain attention to tasks</strong> for longer periods, at home or in preschool/school if she has begun preschool/school at this time.   She understands simple concepts such as time (present, future, past), knows the seasons, recognizes <strong>some letters of the alphabet</strong> and tries to read them, and can write a word such as her name.  Some children can already read at this age.  She can tell you her age, and she’s probably able to count ten objects.  As her thinking develops, you’ll see that she is able to <strong>see things from others’ points of view</strong>.  This can help her make friends (“My friend likes animals, so let’s pretend to be horses”).  She is also able to use these thinking skills to feel what another person is feeling (empathy)—“I’m sad because my father looks sad.” </p>\n\n<h3> </h3>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play continues to be the most important way that your child learns new things.  Read and tell stories together to develop love of words and understanding of reading.  Let her use pencils to write or pretend-write shopping lists or letters to grandparents.  Count objects as you do everyday tasks.  Some children are beginning preschool/school at this time.  If this is your child’s first experience, it will open a whole new social world, and with it a whole set of new rules to learn. This can be challenging for your child.  She may be worried or upset; you can help by reassuring her, telling positive stories about preschool/school, and—if you see the need—sharing your concerns with your child’s teacher.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child’s <strong>movements are more coordinated</strong> now.  Depending on your environment, she may learn to ride a bike, jump over a rope, jump, and skillfully catch a ball. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it may seem to you that your child never rests - she may <strong>wiggle and fidget</strong> while watching TV, eating at the table and even while sleeping.  She has lots of energy at this age! Your child’s <strong>fine motor skills are also becoming more precise</strong>-- - now she can fasten shoelaces, button, zip up a comb her hair, and so on. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Within your community environment, find ways for your child to learn and practice new physical skills by herself or with friends.  You may have some traditional games that your family can teach her.  Find many ways for her to use that physical energy in safe, appropriate ways.  Encourage her to use her fine motor skills not only in dressing herself but perhaps in helping a younger brother or sister.  She will enjoy feeling important.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 61st to the 72nd month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Has a very short attention span</li>\n\t<li>Is not at all interested in letters, numbers, reading or writing</li>\n\t<li>Seems not to hear well</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t speak clearly in sentences of 5 or more words</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t tell longer stories using complete sentences</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t dress and use toilet without help</li>\n\t<li>Can’t take part in conversations</li>\n\t<li>Can’t play in more than one way</li>\n\t<li>Can’t give her name and address</li>\n\t<li>Can’t stand or hop on one foot</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen.

If you talk to her in everyday conversation, she will want to talk to you more.  If she sees that you enjoy talking with her, she'll begin to enjoy it too. Be patient--your child will still not be able to express herself well, so sometimes you'll need to help a bit: „Oh, is that what you played with your friend?  What else did you do?  Did you throw the ball?“ Talk about ordinary things that happen - what we do, where we have been, what we plan, what we like and what we don't.

Increasingly, she will be able to say what bothers her instead of yelling or hitting. </p>\n\n<p>During this period, children usually like to be <strong>surrounded by other people</strong>. You may see your child wanting to please her friends and wanting to be just like them.  Imaginary friends may still be an important part of your child's growing up, although real friends are the most important to her.  She is beginning to get along better and better with others.  You're likely to see her apologize, accept rules, wait for turns, and enjoy it when nice things happen to others.  Even though she can still be rather demanding or impatient, she more often <strong>cooperates and wants to help</strong> others.  At the same time, she may <strong>worry about new experiences</strong>, such as beginning preschool or playing with new children.</p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Encourage your child to be involved in various activities such as family routines, play, and socializing with other children. Share her enjoyment.  Create opportunities in which the child will feel useful and important- a little help while doing household chores, followed by praise, will encourage her to develop self-confidence. Avoid criticism, and praise the effort. If help is needed, give clear instructions and explanations.</p>\n\n<p>If she avoids trying something new or is already afraid of starting preschool, let her become familiar with the new situation and give it a try when she is ready.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play is still a way for a child to learn about herself and about the world around her. At this age, your child will use her<strong> imagination</strong> intensively.  She will probably love to sing, dance, and pretend.  She is better able to know the difference between what is pretend and what is real.   However, at the same time, she may <strong>hide the truth</strong> from her parents if she has done something she knows they do not like.  In her play, she may try <strong>different roles and behaviours</strong> - such as a doctor or a teacher.  During this period she may become more aware of her gender and gender roles.  </p>\n\n<p>Your child's learning also includes learning about her own body and other's bodies—including curiosity about boys' and girls' bodies. Interest and curiosity about the body continue - both theirs and other people's bodies. You can find a child of this age watching her genitals or the genitals of other children with interest. </p>\n\n<p><strong> Concepts </strong>develop rapidly in this period and are foundational for later learning.  Your child is understanding more about opposites (for example, low/high), and she can usually name quite a few <strong>letters and numbers</strong>, and print some of them.  She can correctly count objects up to 10.  Her memory's getting better.  She probably remembers her address or phone number.  She may know the difference between left and right. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>In conversation and daily routines, talk about time concepts (morning, evening, today, etc. and days of the week), as well as other interesting concepts.  Use stories and children’s books to explore other concepts.  Enrich story reading or storytelling by asking your child what she thinks might happen next. Take walks around the community to explore sights and sounds that stimulate her thinking.  Create opportunities to use letters and numbers in daily activities, such as writing a note to help you remember foods to buy at the market. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is <strong>more and more physically skilled</strong> – now she can throw, catch, swing and climb, and build a tower with several small objects.  She can probably hop and perhaps even skip.  She finds it easier to <strong>dress herself</strong> now.  She's also able to <strong>take care of more of her own needs</strong>.  For example, she may feed herself using a spoon or other utensils.  She may use the toilet independently and can brush her teeth wash herself without much help. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Remind her of safety rules and be sure to supervise physical activities as needed.  Create opportunities for your child to be active outdoors and teach her skills as she becomes eager to learn them.  Encourage her fine motor skills by providing simple materials for her to put together, and to draw pictures. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to the <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<h2> </h2>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 49th to the 60th month</strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your paediatrician [or another health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Can't confidently walk, run, climb, jump or use stairs </li>\n\t<li>Can't answer simple questions (What's your name? Who is your family? What's your favourite story?)</li>\n\t<li>Can't follow a two-part direction (Put a cup on the table! Or Take the ball under the bed!) </li>\n\t<li>Can't perform daily routines such as eating or dressing on her own </li>\n\t<li>Seems to have difficulty holding a pencil</li>\n\t<li>Shows extreme behaviour (such as extremely fearful, or aggressive, or sad)</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t talk about daily activities</li>\n\t<li>Doesn't show interest in interacting with either adults or children</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviours are related to spending time in front of the screen. Be sure to limit the time in front of the screen to a maximum of one hour a day and make sure you spend every moment in front of the screen with your child to guide her through that experience. </p>\n",

At this age, most children can compose <strong>sentences</strong> of 2 to 5 words, and it is easier to understand what your child is saying to you.  He will slowly learn how to listen and wait for his turn and will be able to keep up a <strong>short conversation</strong>.  During this period, your child learns how to <strong>describe things</strong> that have happened during the day.  With a little help from you, he can even begin to tell a simple story in sequence.  How exciting for him and for you! </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>               Establish a shared reading time with your child and allow him to turn the pages of a picture book by himself. Teach your child simple songs and rhymes, perhaps from your own childhood or traditions. Ask your child to show you things in pictures and encourage him to repeat the words after you, even if it does not sound much like your pronunciation.  Your child will be interested in the names of things.  Try to not just say the name, but some descriptive words (like \"yes, it’s a big blue truck,” or “Ball—the ball is big, isn’t it?”). </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>This is a <strong>very important period for your child`s emotional development</strong>. Your child experiences lots of feelings every day—from intense happiness to sadness, frustration, and, sometimes, anger.  At the same time, he is learning about <strong>other people`s feelings</strong>, including the <strong>beginnings of empathy</strong>--feeling the way someone else may be feeling.   As when he was younger, he still may have some angry outbursts or temper tantrums.  He still has a <strong>hard time putting big feelings into words</strong>.  During this period, your child will also begin to understand how his behavior affects yours, and also how your behavior affects him.  Now he is apt to be less worried about <strong>separating </strong>from you, although it may still be hard at times, and every child is different. </p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Talk with your child about feelings, tell stories or read age-appropriate books about all kinds of emotions.  Encourage him to make believe about emotions with his toys or other objects.  Accept that he still cannot manage his big feelings sometimes and use your calmness to create a secure environment for him.  And playing, especially make-believe play, is a wonderful way for him to understand and cope with feelings.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is slowly beginning to understand <strong>important ideas like time</strong> (such as day and night, before and after) <strong>and opposites</strong> (big and small).  Also, in this period, he will probably show you that he understands the <strong>purposes of different parts of his body</strong> (“I see with my eyes”).  He begins to try <strong>grouping   objects</strong> by colour, size or shape. He will also start <strong>solving simple problems through trial and error</strong>—“If the spoon doesn’t fit in the jar, maybe I can try a smaller one.”</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Remember that your child continues to learn best through exploration and play.  New concepts can be explored by using objects and by playing pretend.  Encourage your child to play lots of “pretend games” and sometimes join in the game your child is leading.  Continue to involve him in everyday experiences that let you explore together and try out new things:  “Let’s plant some flowers today!”  or “Can you find a good place to put those cups? Thank you!”</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is becoming <strong>much more independent</strong>. During this period, your child can get dressed and undressed on his own—not perfectly, of course-- wash his hands or eat by himself. An important aspect of becoming independent is the use of the toilet.  In many cultures and families, this typically begins during this time. Your child’s  <strong>movements are more complex</strong> than earlier. By the end of the third year of life your child can probably <strong>run and jump</strong>, stand on one leg, go up and downstairs (if home has stairs), and maybe <strong>try to ride</strong> a small scooter or tricycle if available.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child will be eager to try new things but he needs for your support. Encourage him to try, whether or not he is successful at first—and celebrate new skills.  You can also build skills and confidence by including him in everyday family chores—helping sort clean socks, shopping trips, stirring food for a meal, and other simple tasks that fascinate him.</p>\n\n<p>If you are nearby, your child will be more willing to try to climb, hop, draw, throw a ball, or explore other new challenges.  Just by your presence, you are creating a secure environment for development. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<h2> </h2>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 25th to the 36th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period  give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Doesn’t look at you (eye contact)</li>\n\t<li>has difficulties hearing or seeing some things  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t speak in short sentences (at least 3 words together)  </li>\n\t<li>has very unclear speech  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>doesn’t follow simple instructions  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t want to play with other children or with toys and other objects</li>\n\t<li>doesn’t make-believe or pretend during play  </li>\n\t<li>cannot run  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t scribbling or drawing  </li>\n\t<li>cannot hold small objects in his hand.  </li>\n</ul>",

Sometimes you might not know why your baby is crying, but even then, it is important to comfort him with your presence, voice, cuddling, stroking and gentle rocking. All this helps him feel safe. By listening to the different ways in which your baby cries, you will gradually learn what he is trying to tell you. Remember - you cannot spoil a baby by holding him in your arms, feeding him, cuddling him or talking and singing to him in a gentle voice. </p>\n\n<p>Listen to his cry and try to understand the reason for crying. The baby may cry because he just wants your touch or because he is hungry, has some discomfort (uncomfortable body position or a wet diaper), he is sleepy, has cramps or because something else hurts. Always comfort your baby by addressing him in a warm, soothing voice, taking him in your arms, rocking and cuddling him. Do not be afraid, you will not spoil him. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby would rather <strong>look at your face</strong>, and other human faces, than anything else.  You are the center of his life.  He wants and needs to be close to you.  This is his <strong>first relationship</strong> and it is a powerful one.  He <strong>loves to be touched</strong>, but not in a way that is too quick or rough.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Because your baby is not yet able to see a lot of things at a distance, get up close to him when you can—“Here I am!  Look!” Keep physical contact with the baby as often as possible - hold him in your arms, cuddle him. Enjoy skin-to-skin contact. Talk to him, make eye contact and smile as you feed, dress or bathe him.  Help him become calm by handling him gently and soothingly, and by speaking softly to him. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Until now, your baby has been developing within the safe space of his mother's womb.  Birth is a big change for him.  Now he will <strong>learn by seeing, hearing and touching</strong>. During this period, human faces are the most interesting thing for your baby. By the end of the first month, your baby will probably be able to <strong>follow your face with his eyes</strong> if it is close enough (at about 20 to 30 cm). Things that have striking, <strong>contrasting colours</strong> - black and white or red and white, will also be very interesting for him. He may hear and recognize your voice, but sometimes he might be startled by a sudden sound and react with his whole body.  At the end of this month, your baby will be <strong>much more alert and responsive</strong> than at the time of his birth—great changes in just a few weeks!</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>The time he spends with you every day is key to his overall development and the development of his brain.  The way you respond to your baby’s needs will shape his image of the world and the people in it.  It is so simple and so important.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Even though your baby’s nervous system is still maturing, he is developing rapidly during the first month of life.  By the end of the first month, your baby may <strong>try to lift his head briefly</strong> when he is lying on his tummy or <strong>turn it to the side</strong> when he is lying on his back. This helps him to see where you are and observe the exciting world around him. Sometimes he will <strong>hold your finger</strong> firmly with his hand, but most of the time he will keep his hands in a tight fist.   He may quiver or jerk<strong> his arms</strong> and legs in movements that will become more coordinated later, and he sometimes brings his hands near his eyes and mouth. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Besides holding your baby, place him on his back to sleep for safety, and give him some very brief “tummy times” on your lap when he is not sleeping or being held.  Give him the freedom to use his arms and legs, but also try wrapping him cosily (swaddling) when he is distressed. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the 1st month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had earlier, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your baby is crying a lot, and you are not able to comfort him  </li>\n\t<li>He sucks poorly and feeds very slowly  </li>\n\t<li>He sleeps more than expected (more than 16 hours a day), or he does not sleep peacefully  </li>\n\t<li>He is not moving his arms or legs at all </li>\n\t<li>He does not startle when a loud noise is made </li>\n\t<li>He does not blink at bright lights.</li>\n</ul>",

This is expected during the second month of development, and it will continue during the third month.  It actually means that your baby is learning to communicate with you. His <strong>cries are more distinct</strong> now—different cries to indicate his hunger, discomfort, or tiredness.   You will also begin to notice that he is making <strong>cooing sounds</strong> (may be “ooh” or “aah”) and gurgles. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p> It will take him a while to make sure you understand the way he communicates, so it is important to respond to your baby’s cry every time.  Speak to your baby clearly and slowly when your baby makes a sound, express joy with your facial expressions and voice and repeat his sounds. </p>\n\n<p>            </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby has <strong>developed a relationship</strong> with you and recognizes you - mostly by your smell and voice.  He tries to look for you and other special people.  During this period, he may already respond to you with his first <strong>smile</strong>—a magical moment.  </p>\n\n<p>He will generally become more sensitive to sounds during the second month - not only will he recognise you when you speak to him, but he will also <strong>respond to your voice</strong> by looking for your face when you talk to him.  He still needs your comfort, of course, but he is becoming able to <strong>comfort himself</strong>, for example by putting his fist in his mouth. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Whenever you respond by satisfying your baby's need - feeding him, changing his wet clothes, or  reaching out to him with your voice and touch - he will feel comforted and safe.  Always soothe your baby by speaking in a soft voice, gentle touching, rocking or singing. Your baby likes to be near you. He likes to look around and listen.  Rock him, sing and talk to him,  use baby talk, and play with him often. Pay attention to what pleases him and what soothes him.  Help him learn to calm himself—it is fine for him to suck on his fingers. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>He is <strong>learning a lot through his eyes</strong> – for example, he follows interesting objects with his eyes.  He is <strong>curious about faces</strong> he sees, which are another source of new information for your baby.   He may start being<strong> bored</strong> and fussy if an activity does not change, or <strong>overstimulated</strong> if there is too much change.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>When your baby is on his tummy, you can put a toy with bright colours in front of him and move it from one side to the other. If your baby starts complaining, turning his head to the side or crying during playing, it can be a sign of excessive stimulation. You may need to slow down the play a little or take a break.  However, you can also observe whether perhaps he is a bit bored and will enjoy a new activity or just being carried to a different part of the room.  You know your baby best!  You can offer your baby different things that he can look at, touch and hold in his hand. When he is lying on his back, hold a toy or rattle above his head, at eye level, and encourage him to reach for it.  This is a new and interesting problem for him to solve.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>By the end of the second month,  your baby’s motor skills become better and better.   Children develop on different timelines, but during this period, he will probably be able to<strong> </strong><strong>lift</strong><strong> </strong><strong>his</strong><strong> </strong><strong>head and move</strong> it from side to side when he is on his tummy.  His <strong>arm and leg movements are smoother</strong> and more coordinated than when he was a newborn.  It is interesting for him to discover his body, so <strong>his</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hands and fingers</strong> will probably be the most amusing for him in this period. For example, he will explore his hands by looking at them, putting them together and separating them, and with your help, he will be able to <strong>hold an object</strong> in his hands.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p> Put your baby on his tummy when he is awake, with interesting, safe objects near him.  Stroke and massage your baby - you will encourage his motor development.  At the same time,  you will bond with him and be able to comfort him if he is distressed.  </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development during the 2nd month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>the baby frequently cries a lot, and you are not usually able to soothe him   </li>\n\t<li>he isn’t watching faces even for a short time   </li>\n\t<li>he isn’t responding to bright light or loud sounds   </li>\n\t<li>he isn’t feeding or sleeping well (or sleeps more than 16 hours a day)   </li>\n\t<li>he isn’t moving his arms or legs at all</li>\n\t<li>he isn`t bringing his hands to his mouth   </li>\n\t<li>he isn’t smiling at people.  </li>\n</ul>",

Although crying is still his most important signal, the period of intense crying will slowly come to an end, because your baby will now try to communicate with you in different ways. For example, you will see his <strong>smile,</strong> or even give a loud <strong>laugh</strong>, when he sees or experiences something that he likes.  He will often try to respond to you by <strong>cooing</strong> or making a vowel sound like “aaaah”!  He loves making sounds, so you may also hear his babble when you leave him alone.  Sometimes he even copies sounds that he hears.  He is really communicating now!</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>               When you hold and talk happily to him, he will listen carefully, and sometimes try to repeat your voice sounds.   So do this often.  Talk to your baby, and be sure to listen to his response.  When he makes sounds, show him that you are happy and excited to hear them.  He will also enjoy hearing you copy some of his babbling sounds.  Make time in your day for quiet play times when you sing to your baby, tell him a story, or show a book to him.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby continues to be <strong>fascinated by faces</strong>.  He can observe them carefully and for a long time.  He is so interested in you—he <strong>may copy your smile</strong> and even a frown. Around this period, he will also begin to connect what you are saying with your facial expression. Now he can also recognize the voices of people who look after him and <strong>turns his head when he hears them</strong>.   At this age, you will see him spontaneously smile at special people.   You will also notice that your baby <strong>loves to play with people</strong>.  You could say that right now people are his favourite toys!</p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>While talking or listening to him, always look him in the eye.  Give him lots of chances to watch your facial expressions. Smile at him and show that you enjoy imitating him. Hold him in your arms, caress him, smile at him, use baby talk with him, talk and sing to him, and shower him with attention every day. Pay attention to what pleases your baby and fulfil his needs.  By doing so, you will make him happy. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>He will want to <strong>explore the world with his own hands</strong>. Sometime during this period, he will start <strong>reaching for objects</strong> in his surroundings, and he will try to put things he can grab in his mouth. As your baby is using his hands and fingers more, you may find him staring at his hands in admiration and often using them as his first very fun toys.  During this period, he is also <strong>learning by looking</strong>.  His eyes follow moving objects.  Of course he loves faces but he is also learning by watching them.  He begins to recognize people, and also familiar objects, not just when they are up close, but now when they are further away.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Allow him to explore by giving him the possibility to grasp safe objects of different shapes, textures and colours.  Let him enjoy them with both the sense of touch and the sense of taste.  Put interesting objects in his hands and help him to hold them.  Play games like peek-a-boo. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>During the third and fourth month, you will notice that your baby can better <strong>control the movements of his head.</strong> He does not need as much support for his head when you hold him in your arms or put him down. Your baby is <strong>exploring possible ways of moving</strong>. When you put him on his tummy, he may be able to raise his head and support himself with his arms.  He <strong>may also be able to roll over</strong> from his tummy to his back.  He can now not just hold a toy or other object, but he can also <strong>shake an object and swing at an object</strong> that is dangled in front of him.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Give your baby many opportunities to use his body in different ways.  Get down on the floor with him for some play times.  Find simple everyday objects that he can hold and explore.   Your baby needs to explore with his mouth, but only with safe objects.  Be especially careful about small things that could cause choking. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 3rd to the 4th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your baby frequently cries a lot and cannot be comforted  </li>\n\t<li>he isn’t making eye contact or paying attention to people's faces  </li>\n\t<li>he doesn’t watch things as they move  </li>\n\t<li>he isn’t making any sounds or responding to sounds  </li>\n\t<li>he can’t hold his head steady </li>\n\t<li>he isn’t reaching for a toy or object that is in front of him</li>\n\t<li>he doesn’t bring things to his mouth. </li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n",

Encourage him with a smile or by repeating the sounds he made, so that you help the conversation between you last as long as possible. </p>\n\n<p>Talk to your child every day.  Encourage communication in many ways--sing to him,  look with him at pictures in magazines, point to things in shop windows and describe them, read aloud simple books or tell him stories and make interesting sounds (the cat says “miaow,” the cow says “moooo”!). When your baby looks at something, talk about what he sees.  Say things to your child as you prepare for breastfeeding or as you prepare a meal (“Now I’m getting your fruit”); that’s one way that he will learn to wait a little and be patient.  Words help in many ways!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In this period, most babies begin to <strong>recognize familiar persons</strong>, such as parents, other close family members, and familiar child care providers, and enjoy interacting with them.  Your baby is learning to rely on these special people for comfort and help. He knows who is familiar and who is a stranger-- <strong>he may even show fear of new people</strong>.  Your baby will be able to <strong>use sounds to clearly express feelings</strong>.  He shows his joy and happiness by squealing or making other delighted sounds.  And he is able to use sounds to show intense dissatisfaction, anger or indignation. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby needs your emotional support.  Therefore, it is important that you are there for him, especially when there are strangers around. Stay close to him, hold him in your arms, smile at him and talk to him in a soothing voice as you introduce him to new people. That way, he will feel safe and secure to make new contacts.  Interpret your child's moods. When he is happy, continue with the activity. If he is upset, take a break and comfort him.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>               </em></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>His intensive exploration is helping him develop his thinking skills.  He is <strong>looking curiously at objects</strong> and scenes in his environment.  If something is out of his reach, he tries to <strong>reach</strong> for it so that he can explore even more.  He is probably starting to <strong>move things from one hand into another</strong>, and to explore objects with his <strong>mouth</strong>. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby will find many ways to explore on his own, but you can also show him different, interesting ways to use toys or other objects:  moving them from hand to hand, shaking, banging, pushing, and throwing.  Be aware of safety, especially when your baby is exploring with his mouth.  You might also try active games in front of a mirror for some new perspectives! </p>\n\n<p>When your baby drops an object, pick it up and return it to him.  This helps him learn about cause and effect (“if I do this, that happens), and about how to think about the space around him.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In this period, your baby is probably able to <strong>lift and hold his head</strong> on his own.  He will probably manage to be in a <strong>sitting position</strong> for some time while you support him and maybe even on his own.  He will <strong>roll from one side to the other</strong>.  All of this gives your baby a whole new perspective on the world--now he can see things that he could not see while lying on his back.  Because he can now change his position, he becomes interested and <strong>curious about more and more things</strong> around him.  He <strong>looks carefully at objects</strong> that surround him, following them closely with his eyes if they move. During this period, he will also develop the skill of <strong>reaching for objects</strong>, and once he grasps them, he will enjoy exploring them by putting them in his mouth or passing them from one hand to the other hand.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play on the floor with your baby every day.  Every day, during your regular routines, give your baby a lot of opportunities to explore the environment and interesting objects around him.  Let him see the environment in different ways by putting him in different positions.   You can place your child's favourite object a little out of reach, and you can encourage him to get to it. Think about what safe, simple objects he can explore.  What can he pick up, touch, and turn over?  All of this is developing his movement skills and opening new opportunities to explore the world.   <strong>             </strong></p>\n\n<p>             To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 5th to the 6th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your baby regularly cries for a long time and cannot be comforted  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t making eye contact with you or isn’t following moving objects with his eyes  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>isn’t babbling or turning towards the source of a sound  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t laughing or making squealing sounds  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t rolling over  </li>\n\t<li>has no control over his neck and head  </li>\n\t<li>cannot sit even with your help and support or  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>isn’t reaching for objects at all even when you encourage him to do so</li>\n\t<li>doesn’t try to get things that are within reach</li>\n\t<li>has difficulty getting things to his mouth. </li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n",

Now, even if I’m scared, your closeness, hugs and gentle words help to melt my fear away. Other new things are happening—I know my name, and I’ll turn and look at you when you call my name.  I know other words, too, and may try to say some of them.  Games like peek-a-boo excite me because they help me know that things and people may disappear, but they can also come back to me.  And—big news—I’m beginning to sit, crawl, and try to stand.  So many ways to explore and discover now!”",
            "body": "<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 7th to the 9th month </strong></h1>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>From the 7th to the 9th month, your baby will babble most of the time.  His babbling can sound like real talking, using the rhythms of speech even though you cannot understand the words.  In this period, some babies will already say their first word, probably sounding like “ma-ma” or “da-da”, even though the baby will still not know its exact meaning.  At this age your baby will show that he understands some other words – for example, when you say,  “Where is mama?” or “Where is your papa?” he may look around for his mother or his father.  Or he might stop what he is doing when he hears the word “no.”    </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Talk with your baby as you go about your ordinary daily routines.  He loves to hear you talk with him.  It is easy:  just tell him what you are doing, what you’re going to do, or name the objects that you’re using or that are around him.  This helps your baby connect things with their names and meanings. When your baby babbles, respond warmly.  For example, if he babbles “ah-ah-ah” as he looks at fruit in the kitchen, you might copy his sounds and also say “Oh, do you see the apples?  See, here’s an apple!”    Besides talking with him, also sing, play songs, tell stories and read to him, every day.  This shows him how much you love him and helps him learn how to communicate.</p>\n\n<p>              </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>At this age, even without words your baby will be able to let you know, very clearly, when he is happy or upset. These months are a time when your baby is developing a strong bond or attachment to you or close family members or caregivers.  But at the same time, he’s developing a fear of new people.  If a friendly neighbour comes to visit, your baby might hide or cry—even if he went happily to the person a few months before.  He is probably quite definite about who his favourite people are and will look for their attention and help.  He will use his new physical skills to move close to you or another special person, smile, and expect you to respond.  If you leave the room even briefly, he may get upset.   If he is upset about that or other things, he will look for a comforting cuddle. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Remember, these are normal, typical behaviours at this age—and they show that he knows who are the important people in his world and how much he cares about you.   Even though it is hard sometimes, be patient and provide your baby with a sense of security when he meets new people.  Pay attention to how your baby reacts to new situations and people, as his reactions will probably change from week to week.  If new people become part of his world, try to help him get used to them gradually, so that he feels comfortable.  Name the feelings you notice in your child—“Yes, I see that you are feeling scared.  It will be all right; I’m here.  Let’s see if we can help you feel better.” </p>\n\n<p>If you need to spend time away from your baby on a regular basis, for example, if he attends a child care program, make sure that your baby has some of his favourite things with him and is familiar with the care provider.  If possible, choose a setting in which he will be with the same care provider every day. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Because your baby is beginning to crawl and perhaps even stand with help, a whole new part of the world opens up to him. When he reaches interesting objects, he is now able to pick them up with a precise grip and   inspect them very carefully.  If you hide an object with a cloth, he looks for where he saw it last.  He can look for a toy that you cover with a piece of cloth.  If he throws something, he watches it and looks for the place where it fell.  </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play games like peek-a-boo or a “hiding and finding” game—perhaps you put a small toy under a blanket and encourage your baby to pull the blanket to discover the toy.  He will love to repeat these kinds of games, that build thinking skills as well as emotional security.  He will also love to drop small objects into a bowl, take them out again, and do this ever and over.  (Do watch closely, as babies at this age also explore by putting objects in their mouth.)   Let him play with small objects, pushing them around, or rolling balls back and forth.  As he plays, he begins to understand that his actions can make certain things happen (cause/effect)—an important discovery. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>These months bring some exciting developments.  In this period, your baby develops many new motor skills that allow him to discover the charms of the world around him.  Each child develops on an individual timetable, but most likely he is now beginning not only to sit independently but also to move, most often by crawling or rolling.  He is also more and more successful in holding small objects with his fingers.  He skilfully examines objects with his hands, often passing items from one hand to another-- although he will still very often explore objects by putting them in his mouth.  In these areas and in others, your baby’s independence is growing.   In this period and depending on your traditions, you may be introducing your baby to solid foods.  </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Place your baby next to interesting objects that he can pick up safely. Allow your child to move around the room freely as long as the environment is safe and you are nearby to supervise and help if needed.  Make sure that none of the objects your baby handles are too small, to prevent the risk of choking.  Your task is to provide the baby with an environment that is stimulating enough so that he can explore, but also safe enough so that he does not get hurt.  When he discovers something, share his discovery with a big smile or comment (“Look what you found—a cup!  May I see it?”).  In this way, the baby will learn to develop his curiosity and feel safe and protected at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>If he is beginning to eat solid food, allow him to explore different tastes and explore new foods in different ways.  Most children at this age will try to eat on their own (by picking up pieces of food and feeding themselves). </p>\n\n<p>               To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<h2> </h2>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 7th to the 9th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>If your baby isn’t making eye contact with you or isn’t following moving objects with his eyes  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>Isn’t babbling (“mama,” “dada,” etc.)  </li>\n\t<li>Isn’t turning his head towards a sound source  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t look where you point</li>\n\t<li>doesn’t show affection for his caregivers – doesn’t smile at them  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t respond to his own name</li>\n\t<li>doesn’t seem to recognize familiar people</li>\n\t<li>isn’t rolling  </li>\n\t<li>when you lift him, he is either floppy or too stiff  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>he can’t sit even with your help and support  </li>\n\t<li>and has difficulties eating solid food.  </li>\n</ul>",

Although he will still mostly babble, by the end of the first year your baby will probably use and understand at least one word  (such as “ma-ma” or “da-da”). He will <strong>try to communicate</strong> intensively with you in every way he can - not only using words, but also by pointing, moving, nodding, waving... If your baby doesn`t use words yet, do not worry. He will find other way to attract your attention and let you know what he wants.   He will understand you more and more.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Talk to your baby during daily rituals - dressing, feeding, walking, shopping… Just name what you do or what you see around you—it’s not a lesson, just a conversation!  If he tries to talk, give him sounds meaning by adding a bit—for example, when he says \"da-da\" or “ma-ma” you could respond \"Yes, Dad has come\" or “Yes, Mummy has come”). By doing this, you’re enriching his vocabulary and building his communication skills.</p>\n\n<p>During this period, you may notice that he <strong>understands short instructions</strong> such as \"give it to your sister\", \"wave bye-bye\" or \"don’t touch it.\"  Recognize his new understanding by giving him a big smile or praise.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>As when he was younger, your baby will probably still show some <strong>stranger anxiety.  </strong>He may still be <strong>scared and start to cry</strong> when you <strong>leave</strong> the room. As his emotional development progresses, he  will become more and more <strong>aware</strong> of his <strong>needs</strong>.  And as he becomes better at communicating, he’ll be able to let you know his desires and feelings.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to reassure your baby if he avoids new people.  Give him everyday experiences in which you may leave briefly—even to get a toy from another room—and come back.  Games like hide-and-seek or peek-a-boo give practice in managing these feelings, too.  Whatever his feelings, listen and try to interpret his wishes and put those feelings into words for him (for example, “Oh, baby is so tired” or “Baby wants that spoon; let me get it for you.”</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New? </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Remember that your baby is in the process of <strong>learning</strong> all the time during this period.  Babies of this age love to find hidden objects under a blanket or a cup.  He  also wants to discover how objects work - often by grabbing, shaking, hitting, throwing, or banging something on the ground (be sure objects are safe!). ... he will enjoy playing with the adults who look after him.  At the end of the first year he may also initiate the play - by showing you the toys with which he is playing.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Just as when he was younger, your baby will still learn best <strong>through play</strong>.  In <strong>Playing Together</strong> section, you’ll find many activities that your baby will love at this age.  Every child is unique, so follow his initiative and support his choice of toys and interests.  Simple everyday objects and activities will enrich his knowledge and thinking abilities.  Read books, tell traditional stories, play music or sing songs, and recite nursery rhymes for him.  Let him turn over the pages of picture books.  Bathing or getting dressed are great times to help him point to body parts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>These months bring some exciting developments.  Most likely, your baby will begin by  <strong>standing by holding onto something.  </strong>Then he may try <strong>standing independently </strong>and perhaps take to his <strong>first steps</strong>. Every child is different, but by the end of this period some babies may even <strong>walk on their own.  </strong>However, walking is a big challenge for babies, and some early walkers will still go back to crawling as an easier way to explore their world.     At the same time, he is becoming more skilled at using his hands and fingers to explore his environment.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>You don’t need to teach a child to walk!  But do find fun, everyday ways to encourage him to move, so that he will build muscle strength for more complex movements.   Now that you have him on the go, check that your home is safe and secure for the little adventurer.  His coordination and use of his hands are improving, too.  You can help by encouraging him to explore different textures of objects with his touch, or to bang one object against another, or to put them into boxes and take them out of them, or to gather food crumbs from the table. Give him crayons to scribble on paper.</p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 10th to the 12th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>your child isn`t making eye contact with you or isn’t following moving objects with his eyes,</li>\n\t<li>is not interested in sounds,</li>\n\t<li>does not respond to his name when you call him,</li>\n\t<li>isn’t babbling,</li>\n\t<li>isn’t trying to let you know in any way what his desires or needs are,</li>\n\t<li>isn’t pointing to objects,</li>\n\t<li>isn’t showing emotions,</li>\n\t<li>isn’t crawling</li>\n</ul>",

If he gets briefly separated from these special adults, you will probably see—and hear--him become very upset.   You do not need to worry about this reaction; it is typical of most children at this age, and actually shows his deep attachment to you.  Other emotions begin to show themselves in this period.  For example, shame may appear in reaction to seeing others’ displeasure at something your baby has done.  He may also begin to show defiance if he has been told not to do something he wants to do. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Give your baby patient, loving attention when he follows directions or tries to manage difficult situations. Encourage him with approval, praise, reassurance, kisses and cuddling for his appropriate, desired behaviours. This will help him, gradually, learn what is expected of him.  If he is upset when you leave him, even briefly, reassure him, accept his emotions, and remind him that you always come back.  Continue to name his feelings and reflect them back to him:  “I know you are really sad because you cannot go outside now.  We will read a story and get ready for your nap now, and we will play outside later.” </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your baby is just beginning to group things that are the same shape or colour.   He also is learning to follow simple instructions, if they have only one or two steps (“Here are your shoes and give them to me so we can go outside.” His exploration becomes even more intense—he is interested in how all kinds of things work. </p>\n\n<p>By the time your baby is 18 months old, you are likely to see “pretend play” appear.  He might pretend to talk on the phone or eat make-believe food, or feed a pretend animal.  Whatever he sees in his environment gives him ideas for pretend play.  All of this strengthens his ability to think creatively and to understand more about the world.  Your baby may also learn through being with other children, even if it is still just watching them as they play side by side. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Because your baby wants to understand what he can do with different things, he will probably enjoy games such as finding a hidden object, pointing to body parts or familiar objects already known to him. The games will be more fun and lead to even more learning if you take turns (me and then you).  For example, this could be throwing a ball, turning pages in a book (one page for me, one page for you), showing different objects (this one for me and this one for you) or games imitating everyday actions.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In this period, your child may be able to stand alone without help and without holding on to something.  Many children take their first steps in this period.  Children of the same age develop differently, but during this period, some children already start running, climbing furniture, or walking up and down stairs if these are in a child’s environment.   Skills like these help your baby become more independent and give him more ways to actively explore the world in which he lives. </p>\n\n<p>During this period, your baby will find it easier than before to use his hands skilfully for many things.  These might include scribbling with a pencil, turning pages in a book or magazine, using a spoon, holding a cup while drinking, or stacking up objects to make a simple tower. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Everyday activities will be the best way to give your baby opportunities to practice his developing physical skills.  If possible, take him outdoors for active play with you—watching him closely for safety.  Ask him to help you do things like opening doors or carrying small items (if he is walking).  Get involved in his activities!  Sing songs together, especially those that have accompanying movements (e.g. singing and touching head, shoulders, knees and toes).  You may know traditional songs and games to teach your baby.</p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 13th to 18th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>that your child has difficulty seeing or hearing some things  </li>\n\t<li>does not say a single word  </li>\n\t<li>finds it difficult to follow even straightforward instructions  </li>\n\t<li>does not use gestures and pointing in communication  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>doesn’t make eye contact with you and does not cuddle  </li>\n\t<li>isn`t walking independently by himself.  </li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n",

When I see something or want something, there is already a word for it - I say it or you say it.  Words are like some magic to me.  And objects can do so many things! I can place one thing on top of the other, one inside another, next to each other, below and above. I love it when you play with me.  When I do something, you do the same thing.  And what you do, I try to repeat. And then together, joyfully, we communicate with words and smiles.  I love it when we can be happy together. Sometimes I get frustrated when I can’t do something.  When that happens, I’ll try to show you what I don’t like with a word or with my body.  If I yell or get really mad, please don’t get angry.  My feelings are strong. Your love and patience help me deal with them.”",
            "body": "<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 19th to the 24th month </strong></h1>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>Children of this age enjoy talking, although it is still a combination of real words and babbling.  At this age, speech development is very rapid.  Children may learn 1 to 2 new words a week, or even more.  Your child will already be able to point at familiar objects, people or body parts during this period.  During this period, your child understands more and more: he recognizes his name and understands the idea of \"mine.\" He is getting better at understanding short sentences and instructions such as \"Bring it to mom\" or “Bring it to daddy.”   By the end of the second year most children will be able to use  \"I\" and \"you\" and say a sentence with 2 to 3 words (for example \"Dad car\" or \"Me do it\"). </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>               Lessons are not important—conversation and play are what your child needs!  Talk to your child during daily routines such as dressing, feeding, walking, or bathing.  Your everyday conversation will enrich your child’s vocabulary.   During your busy day, just listen to what your child says and respond by saying a bit more.  If he says, \"Mom milk\" or “Dad milk”, you may build on what he said by replying, \"Oh, do you want me to get you some milk?\"     </p>\n\n<p>Read or tell stories to your child every day and talk about pictures or objects using simple words.  Encourage him to point to pictures in books or other things he sees, and to use words to describe what he sees.  Ask him simple questions and encourage his answers even if they are hard to understand.  Use games to teach him to name body parts, animals and objects for everyday use. Play animal sound games. Sing nursery rhymes together.  </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>At this age, your child begins to experience more complex feelings-- anger or frustration, guilt, shame, or intense excitement.  These kinds of feelings can be hard for him to deal with. As a result, at this age children often experience a kind of explosion of feelings (a temper tantrum). Children handle intense feelings in different ways, but some may react by crying, screaming, kicking, falling down, or even running out of the room or vomiting. </p>\n\n<p> At this period of development, your child begins to be able to communicate his feelings in simple language and gestures.  He may recognize and even say that \"he is sad\" or hug and kiss you to show comfort and reassurance. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, social and emotional skills are growing.  If he has a chance, he probably enjoys being near other children and playing beside them (although probably not interacting or cooperating in their play just yet).   </p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Describe the feelings that the child expresses or encounters in everyday life or stories.  Try to prevent tantrums through distraction, calming activities, or other ways of soothing him.  Praise positive behaviour more than depending mainly on punishment.  Praise means a lot to him.  If tantrums occur, try to stay calm, protect him from harm, and help him learn how to regain control.</p>\n\n<p>Build his emotional security by asking your child to help you—for example by bringing you something, putting a toy back in its place, turning the page of the book you are looking at together, or helping with simple household chores.  At the same time, he is learning to communicate, reason, and develop physical skills. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>You will notice that your child is beginning to be able to follow a simple direction, perhaps one with two steps (“Pick up your toy and bring to mom (or dad), please”).  He enjoys finding things that are hidden and remembers where objects were before.  He also begins to put objects in groups, such as items that are the same colour or shape.  </p>\n\n<p>You will see your child get more and more involved in \"pretend play.\"  At first, he may just pretend to eat or drink.  As time goes on, his make-believe becomes even more complex—perhaps he pretends that a piece of cloth is a baby that he hugs, pats, and feeds!  Creative thinking and problem solving are developed through this kind of play. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p> Everyday activities help him learn these and other skills.  As you go through your day, ask him simple questions and show enjoyment of his answers.  He can learn body parts as you bathe, comb hair, and dress.  Teach him to name body parts, animals and things for everyday use. Play animal sound games. Sing nursery rhymes together.   Remember that play continues to be the most important way for him to learn.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>By this age, your child will most likely walk independently.  This is exciting for him and for you!  He will also begin to explore and increase his skills in other kinds of movement, such as running and kicking a ball. Depending on the environment, these may also include walking up and downstairs or climbing onto or down from furniture.</p>\n\n<p>You may also see his independence in wanting to dress or undress himself, or to do other things that are new and physically challenging.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>At this age, your child needs a responsible adult nearby while he is playing actively, running, or jumping.   Help him with new physical challenges like getting down from furniture or holding on while climbing stairs.  Keeping your eye on his actions, you will encourage him to try out new ways of moving while you also give him a sense of safety and security. </p>\n\n<p>You can encourage independence in dressing by making it easier for him.  At the beginning, children find it easier to undress than to get dressed (as you often see at inconvenient times!).  At nap- or bedtime, encourage him to participate by taking off socks, shoes, or clothes that do not require unbuttoning<strong>. </strong></p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<h2> </h2>\n\n<h2><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 19th to the 24th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Doesn’t look at you (eye contact)</li>\n\t<li>has  difficulties seeing or hearing certain things  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t say a single word  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t point to objects  </li>\n\t<li>doesn’t follow simple instructions  </li>\n</ul><ul><li>doesn’t show feelings  </li>\n\t<li>isn’t walking steadily  </li>\n</ul>",

During this period, he will <strong>understand most of the things you say</strong> to him, and may be able to guess what some new words mean.  You will also notice that, by the end of this year, your child’s sentences will be longer.  He will also be able to follow more <strong>complex instructions </strong>with two or three parts, such as “Please close the door and come with me.”</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>As always, listen to your child and have enjoyable conversations at all times of the day.  You will find that at this age, your child has a lot to talk about!  Involve him in whatever you are doing and use this as an opportunity to playfully give him instructions or introduce interesting new words into the conversation.   Read and tell stories with your child every day.  You can ask him about the story—what does he think will happen next? </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The period from the third to the fourth birthday is very important for your child’s emotional development. During this period, he learns how <strong>to identify different emotions</strong>.  At this age, he may be able to recognize basic feelings such as happiness, sadness, fear and anger.  You might see him show some other emotions such as fear of imaginary things, concern or worry about how others behave, or love and attachment to people he feels close to.</p>\n\n<p>If he has the opportunity you will see your child making his <strong>first friends</strong> during this year.  Now he will probably begin to <strong>play more cooperatively</strong> with others, in small groups.   Sharing is becoming easier—though not always—as he has some understanding of “mine” and “his.” </p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to create a secure environment for your child.  This makes it easier for him to express and regulate or control his feelings.  As when he was younger, predictable daily routines help create that sense of security.  Help your child know what happens next and what the typical pattern of the day will be.  If he feels safe, it will be.</p>\n\n<p>Because these first friendships are important to your child, try to create opportunities for play with other children.  But stay close to the children, because the child’s social skills at this age are still not well developed, and misunderstandings or conflicts may happen.  You will help by reacting calmly and reasonably.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Play is still the dominant way in which a child of this age learns and explores himself and the world around him, but now your child’s “playful learning”  is becoming <strong>much more imaginative</strong>.  He might have a tea party or pretend to be a doctor with a sick baby.  Some children have imaginary friends at this age.  For the most part, although he loves to pretend, he knows what it real and what’s make-believe.  This is also a period of intense <strong>fascination with the world</strong> around your child.  <strong>Questions, questions, questions</strong> help him learn—who?  What?  why?  He is probably very interested in his own body and others’ bodies. </p>\n\n<p>This year your child will also develop ideas about  opposites such as big / small, and more/less, as well as  other <strong>concepts</strong> such as “on”, “in,” and “below.”  His memory is developing, allowing him to  learn short songs and sing them later. He will also begin to point to and name <strong>some letters and numbers</strong>.   By his fourth birthday, he’ll probably count as many as four objects and group different objects by their similar color and shape.</p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Accept your child’s many questions as his important efforts to learn about the world.  Try to answer simply and honestly without giving too complex  explanations.  If you do not know something, say so.  Show your child ways to find out information—for example, if he asks about birds that he sees, you may find a book or talk with a neighbor who knows all about birds.  Always offer to find the answer together in books or other sources of information.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Between the age of three and four, your child is <strong>very physically active</strong>.  You can see how much he enjoys all kinds of movements.  He has become better at running, climbing, jumping, and balancing on one leg.  He can catch a ball that’s bounced to him, most of the time.  If there are stairs in his environment, he’s better at going up them. </p>\n\n<p>In other ways, your child is becoming <strong>more independent</strong>. He eats on his own, mostly is able to dress himself, uses the toilet independently, and washes himself. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Supervise and help with parts of his personal care that are still difficult, like brushing teeth.  Watch carefully as he climbs, allowing his independence but monitoring his safety.  Give your child the opportunity to try different kinds of activities – those with a lot of movement, and those that are calmer such as drawing and looking at books.  Teach your child traditional outdoor games; dance with him and copy his movements as he can copy yours.  Support activities that your child enjoys.</p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 37th to the 48th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Shows no interest in playing games with others or playing make-believe/pretend games</li>\n\t<li>Ignores other children or does not respond to people outside the family</li>\n\t<li>Can't jump in place</li>\n\t<li>Has difficulty scribbling (making marks on paper)</li>\n\t<li>Does not follow an instruction that has three parts</li>\n\t<li>Can't tell a favorite story</li>\n</ul>",

You will now hear your child use <strong>full complex sentences.</strong>  Sometimes he can lead a conversation almost like an adult, but sometimes he still has a hard time explaining complex ideas or complex events. Now he understands jokes and riddles.  You’ll notice how many <strong>new words</strong> your child is learning every day.  He likes to use these words, but his brain sometimes works faster than he can say them—that’s all right, he’ll catch up soon. </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Continue to have conversations with your child every day.  His new experiences and interests give you a lot to talk about together.  If he struggles with how to explain or pronounce something, gently help him out without criticizing his efforts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child continues to love pretending, but now his <strong>make-believe is much more complex</strong> and dramatic.  Much of his play will be with friends, working together—for example, to make one big sand castle or a pretend house in the garden. He’ll usually be able to share his things, although he won’t always get along with his playmates.  Children may say that others are not following the rules of a game, or other conflicts may happen.  But now your child may be able to <strong>try to solve these conflicts</strong>.  Your child manages his emotions better than at earlier ages, is <strong>more patient and reasonable</strong>, and you’ll see fewer outbursts of anger or overflows of grief.  Disagreements will be fewer and more easily resolved.    </p>\n\n<p>As your child grows and his understanding of the world gets better, <strong>certain fears</strong> may arise. This age is characterized by fears of supernatural beings (ghosts), criticism, failure, physical injury or threat.</p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>During this period, your child may need your support to understand more complex feelings such as frustration or jealousy.  This is important in his understanding of some of the challenges that will come up in preschool/school and in dealing with friendships.  Stories from books or your own experience may help.</p>\n\n<p>Your child is trying hard to be independent.  You can help in encouraging him to make many small decisions (what to wear, what to eat for breakfast, etc.).  Although your child may seem to be very independent in this period, he still needs to connect with you and have your love, care and attention. He is proud of what he is able to do, but he still looks for your approval and probably still finds it difficult to bear criticism and discipline.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is now able to <strong>sustain attention to tasks</strong> for longer periods, at home or in preschool/school if he has begun preschool/school at this time.   He understands simple concepts such as time (present, future, past), knows the seasons, recognizes <strong>some letters of the alphabet</strong> and tries to read them, and can write a word such as his name.  Some children can already read at this age.  He can tell you his age, and he’s probably able to count ten objects.  As his thinking develops, you’ll see that he is able to <strong>see things from others’ points of view</strong>.  This can help him make friends (“My friend likes animals, so let’s pretend to be horses”).  He is also able to use these thinking skills to feel what another person is feeling (empathy)—“I’m sad because my father looks sad.” </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Play continues to be the most important way that your child learns new things.  Read and tell stories together to develop love of words and understanding of reading.  Let him use pencils to write or pretend-write shopping lists or letters to grandparents.  Count objects as you do everyday tasks.  Some children are beginning preschool/school at this time.  If this is your child’s first experience, it will open a whole new social world, and with it a whole set of new rules to learn. This can be challenging for your child.  He may be worried or upset; you can help by reassuring him, telling positive stories about preschool/school, and—if you see the need—sharing your concerns with your child’s teacher.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child’s <strong>movements are more coordinated</strong> now.  Depending on your environment, he may learn to ride a bike, jump over a rope, jump, and skillfully catch a ball. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it may seem to you that your child never rests - he may <strong>wiggle and fidget</strong> while watching TV, eating at the table and even while sleeping.  He has lots of energy at this age! Your child’s <strong>fine motor skills are also becoming more precise</strong> - now he can fasten shoelaces, button, zip up a comb his hair, and so on. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Within your community environment, find ways for your child to learn and practice new physical skills by himself or with friends.  You may have some traditional games that your family can teach him.  Find many ways for him to use that physical energy in safe, appropriate ways.  Encourage him to use his fine motor skills not only in dressing himself but perhaps in helping a younger brother or sister.  He will enjoy feeling important.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 61st to the 72nd month</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Has a very short attention span</li>\n\t<li>Is not at all interested in letters, numbers, reading or writing</li>\n\t<li>Seems not to hear well</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t speak clearly in sentences of 5 or more words</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t tell longer stories using complete sentences</li>\n\t<li>Doesn’t dress and use toilet without help</li>\n\t<li>Can’t take part in conversations</li>\n\t<li>Can’t play in more than one way</li>\n\t<li>Can’t give his name and address</li>\n\t<li>Can’t stand or hop on one foot</li>\n</ul><p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen. Be sure to limit the time in front of the screen to a maximum of one hour a day and make sure you spend every moment in front of the screen with your child to guide him through that experience. </p>\n",

Everything is interesting to me. I would like to try everything! I am proud when I do something, and I love it when you rejoice, too. I control my feelings and wishes better and better, even though it is hard sometimes. I understand almost everything you tell me and I enjoy talking. I like to talk - about what we did and where we were. Let's plan what we'll do tomorrow. I like you to tell stories or read books to me, so I can imagine that I’m one of the people or animals in the story. I also love when we sing songs or make believe together. I have ‘best friends’ that I love to play with. I know the rules and how to behave, but sometimes I forget. When you are angry at me, it makes me feel ashamed or worried, so sometimes I may try to hide what I have done or tell you something that is not true. One other thing – now I can swing and climb really well. ”",
            "body": "<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 49th to the 60th month </strong></h1>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>\n\n<p>This is a period of rapid speech development, exciting to you and your child.  At this age, your child probably <strong>loves telling stories and enjoys conversations</strong>.  Your child may often talk about how he feels, tell about his ideas, and ask questions. </p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of this year, he may know several hundred words and can use sentences of at least five or six words.  Usually you'll understand what he is saying.  And by his fifth birthday, his sentences will be longer and even more complex, with <strong>many more words</strong> available to him.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Every child is different—your child may be  talkative or more quiet.  Whatever his style, always encourage his verbal expression. If you talk to him in everyday conversation, he will want to talk to you more.  If he sees that you enjoy talking with him, he'll begin to enjoy it too. Be patient--your child will still not be able to express himself well, so sometimes you'll need to help a bit: „Oh, is that what you played with your friend?  What else did you do?  Did you throw the ball?“ Talk about ordinary things that happen - what we do, where we have been, what we plan, what we like and what we don't. While reading books or telling stories, you can ask questions about what is happening.  Drawing and playing pretend are other ways to communicate and may support children who are sometimes unwilling to talk.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>\n\n<p>During this period, your child begins to learn how to <strong>express different feelings </strong>in an appropriate way.  He can find more and more ways to express emotions–  speech, explanation, gestures, or  play. Increasingly, he will be able to say what bothers him instead of yelling or hitting. </p>\n\n<p>During this period, children usually like to be <strong>surrounded by other people</strong>. You may see your child wanting to please his friends and wanting to be just like them.  Imaginary friends may still be an important part of your child's growing up, although real friends are the most important to him.  He is beginning to get along better and better with others.  You're likely to see him apologize, accept rules, wait for turns, and enjoy it when nice things happen to others.  Even though he can still be rather demanding or impatient, he more often <strong>cooperates and wants to help</strong> others.  At the same time, he may <strong>worry about new experiences</strong>, such as beginning preschool or playing with new children.</p>\n\n<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Encourage your child to be involved in various activities such as family routines, play, and socializing with other children. Share his enjoyment.  Create opportunities in which the child will feel useful and important- a little help while doing household chores, followed by praise, will encourage him to develop self-confidence. Avoid criticism, and praise the effort. If help is needed, give clear instructions and explanations.</p>\n\n<p>If he avoids trying something new or is already afraid of starting preschool, let him become familiar with the new situation and give it a try when he is ready.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Play is still a way for a child to learn about himself and about the world around him.   At this age your child will use his<strong> imagination</strong> intensively.  He will probably love to sing, dance, and pretend.  He is better able to know the difference between what is pretend and what is real.   However, at the same time he may <strong>hide the truth</strong> from his parents if he has done something he knows they do not like.  In his play, he may try <strong>different roles and behaviors</strong> - such as a doctor or a teacher.  During this period he may become more aware of his gender and gender roles.  </p>\n\n<p>Your child's learning also includes learning about his own body and other's bodies—including curiosity about boys' and girls' bodies.  Interest and curiosity about the body continues - both theirs and other people's bodies. You can find a child of this age watching his genitals or the genitals of other children with interest. </p>\n\n<p><strong> Concepts </strong>develop rapidly in this period and are foundational for later learning.  Your child in understanding more about  opposites (for example, low / high), and he can usually name quite a few <strong>letters and numbers</strong>, and print some of them.  He can correctly count objects up to 10.  His memory's getting better.  He probably remembers his address or phone number.  He may know the difference between left and right. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>In conversation and daily routines, talk about time concepts (morning, evening, today, etc. and days of the week), as well as other interesting concepts.  Use stories and children’s books to explore other concepts.  Enrich story reading or storytelling by asking your child what he thinks might happen next. Take walks around the community to explore sights and sounds that stimulate his thinking.  Create opportunities to use letters and numbers in daily activities, such as writing a note to help you remember foods to buy at the market. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your child is <strong>more and more physically skilled</strong> – now he can throw, catch, swing and climb, and build a tower with several small objects.  He can probably hop and perhaps even skip.  He finds it easier to <strong>dress himself</strong> now.  He's also able <strong>take care of more of his own needs</strong>.  For example, he may feed himself using a spoon or other utensils.  He may use the toilet independently and can brush his teeth wash himself without much help. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Remind him of safety rules and be sure to supervise physical activities as needed.  Create opportunities for your child to be active outdoors and teach him skills as he becomes eager to learn them.  Encourage him fine motor skills by providing simple materials for him to put together, and to draw pictures. </p>\n\n<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 49th to the 60th month </strong></h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period  give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>\n\n<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Can't confidently walk, run, climb, jump or use stairs </li>\n\t<li>Can't answer simple questions (What's your name?
