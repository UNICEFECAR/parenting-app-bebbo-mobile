This activity will help your little one to get started with this skill, which with practice they will master in no time. To start, you only need to lay your little one on her back on a soft surface, like your bed. Take one of her legs and cross it in front of the other. Do it again with the other leg. Repeat about three times and on the fourth time, take the leg, cross it in front of the other, put your other hand under her back and help her roll over until she is on her tummy. You can recite the following rhyme while doing the exercises:</p><p><em>     Round and round and you'll change!</em></p><p><em>     What you can see?</em></p><p><em>     Round, round, you will give,</em></p><p><em>     You alone will see!</em></p><p>Remember that all movements must be delicate and that your little one must already have enough strength in her neck to avoid hurting her. Lie her on her back and repeat for the other side. Finish the exercise with lots of kisses. Now talk to your little one to get his or her attention. When you do it, you can repeat the rhyme.</p><p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Help your little one begin to have the strength and coordinated movements to turn from back to tummy, which will allow her to start to have the necessary coordination to move in a few months.</p>",

I can hear the clock ticking, the bus passing, the neighbor arriving by elevator.” Use lots of interesting words like that - even if your child doesn't understand them yet.  </p><p>If the child is older, you can also ask the question \"Where could I find this sound?\" (And then imitate it). Let him enjoy the feeling of discovery and making the connection between the sound and the object that makes it, by naming it.

You may also see your child becoming eager to turn book or magazine pages independently.</p><p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>The action of turning pages is a new fine motor skill, using your child’s hands more skillfully. Your child’s thinking is also strengthened as he makes connections between what is on the pages and the step of turning to see a new picture.</p>",

Постойте молча какое-то время и скажите ребенку сделать то же самое. Можно сказать: «Тс-с-с-с, давай попробуем услышать как можно больше разных звуков». В этот момент можно указать пальцем на свои уши. Вы можете распознать такие звуки, как стук, лай, скрип, дребезжание, царапанье, грохот. Расскажите малышу, что делать: «Давай попробуем назвать все звуки, которые мы слышим. Я слышу, как тикают часы, проезжает автобус, сосед едет в лифте». Разговаривайте интересными и сложными словами, даже если ваш малыш их еще не понимает.  </p><p>Если ребенок постарше, можно спросить у него: «От чего такой звук?». И воспроизведите какой-либо из знакомых звуков. Пусть испытает радость открытия и обнаружения связи между звуком и предметом, который его издает. Проговорите с ребенком название предмета или процесса. Благодаря таким действиям у малыша расширяется словарный запас, а язык обогащается более сложными  конструкциями. </p><p>Вы можете использовать эту игру практически в любой бытовой ситуации — во время игр и в свободное время, но также и при выполнении повседневных дел: при одевании, приготовлении еды, умывании, в магазине, на прогулке, в машине и (если позволяет эпидемиологическая обстановка) на остановке в ожидании автобуса или в очереди в банке, на почте или в поликлинике.</p><p><strong>Чему при этом учится ребенок. </strong>Ваш ребенок всегда в восторге, когда вы что-то делаете вместе с ним и когда вы с ним играете. Он копирует мимику, жесты и некоторые действия близких людей, показывает пальцем на то, что его интересует, или предлагает предметы другим людям, чтобы обратить на себя внимание и вовлечь их в игру. Все это расширяет его словарный запас и помогает исследовать окружающий мир. Давайте малышу возможность изучать все вокруг и рассказывать вам, что он слышит, даже если его речь пока — это лепет или самые простые слова.</p>",

Може да чуете удряне, скимтене, скърцане, тропане, драскане, бърборене. Насърчете детето „Да видим дали можем да назовем звуците, които можем да чуем. Чувам как часовникът тиктака, как минава автобусът, как съседът пристига с асансьора.“ Използвайте множество интересни думи като тези – дори ако детето ви все още не ги разбира.</p><p>Ако детето е по-голямо, можете също да го попитате „Къде мога да открия този звук?“ (И след това имитирайте звука).

Помолчите немного и поощряйте ребенка делать то же самое.  Скажите что-то вроде «ш-ш-ш, давай послушаем, какой звук мы можем уловить», а затем покажите на свои уши. Вы можете услышать стук, вой, скрип, скрежет, царапанье, дребезжание. Поощряйте ребенка: «Давай посмотрим, сможем ли мы собрать звуки, которые мы слышим. Я слышу, как тикают часы, как проезжает автобус, как сосед поднимается на лифте».  Используйте много интересных слов такого рода, даже если ваш ребенок еще не понимает их.  </p><p>Если ребенок старше, вы также можете задать вопрос «Где я могу найти этот звук?».

Таким образом, язык будет связан с понятиями и обогатит словарный запас. </p><p>Вы можете использовать это занятие практически в любой жизненной ситуации - во время свободной игры и свободного времени, а также во время повседневной рутины - одевания, приготовления еды, гигиенических процедур, походов по магазинам, прогулок, вождения автомобиля и (если позволяют местные санитарные правила) ожидая автобус или в очереди в банке, на почте или к врачу.</p><p><strong>Что изучает ваш ребенок:  </strong>Ваш ребенок с нетерпением ждет занятий с вами, и пока вы вместе играете, он/она имитирует мимику, жесты и некоторые действия близких людей, показывает указательным пальцем на то, что его / её интересует, или предлагает что-то другим людям, чтобы заинтересовать их и вовлечь в игру. Эта деятельность расширяет его / ее словарный запас и знания о мире. Пусть ваш ребенок исследует окружающее пространство и рассказывает вам, что он/она слышит, даже с помощью лепета или простых слов.</p>",

Ova aktivnost će pomoći Vašoj bebi da brzo ovladava tom vještinom. Za početak, stavite bebu na leđa, neka leži na nekoj mekoj podlozi (npr. na krevetu). Prekrstite jednu bebinu nožicu preko druge, a zatim isto uradite s drugom nogom. Ponovite vježbu otprilike tri puta, a četvrti put uvedite novi korak: kad uzmete bebinu nogu i prekrstite je preko druge, podvucite ruku, malko odignite bebina leđa i pomozite joj da se prevrne na stomak. Vježbu ispratite nekom brojalicom, npr.: <em>Jedan, dva i tri, na stomačiću si sada ti!</em></p><p>Imajte na umu: svi pokreti moraju biti delikatni, a bebin vrat mora biti već dovoljno snažan da se ne bi povrijedio tokom vježbe. Sve iste korake ponovite i prilikom okreta na drugu stranu. Vježbu završite s puno poljubaca i uzvika BRAVO! Razgovarajte malo sa svojom bebom kako biste joj zadržali pažnju, a onda ponovite vježbu prateći je brojalicama i rimama.</p><p><strong>Što dijete uči: </strong>Vaša beba<strong> </strong>stiče snagu mišića koja joj je potrebna da se prevrne s leđa na stomak i obratno. Ujedno, razvija koordinaciju pokreta, što će joj omogućiti da u narednih nekoliko mjeseci uspostavi koordinaciju potrebnu za kretanje.</p>",

Sve što treba da uradite jeste da svakodnevno sprovodite jednu jednostavnu aktivnost. Zastanite, a onda pažljivo osluškujte kako biste uhvatili sve zvukove u sobi ili u svom okruženju. Primirite se za trenutak i podstaknite Vaše dijete da učini isto. Možete reći nešto poput: „Šššššš, hajde da čujemo koji zvuk možemo uhvatiti“, pokazujući na svoje uši. Kad smo tihi, možemo čuti obilje zvukova oko nas: lupkanje, cviljenje, škripanje, zveckanje, grebanje, čavrljanje. Ohrabrite dijete: „Hajde da vidimo možemo li sakupiti zvukove koje čujemo. Evo, ja čujem sat kako otkucava, autobus prolazi, komšija dolazi liftom.“ Koristite što više zanimljivih riječi, čak i ako znate da ih Vaše dijete još ne razumije.</p><p>Ako je dijete starije, možete postaviti i pitanje: „Gdje mogu da pronađem ovaj zvuk?“ (nakon čega ćete oponašati traženi zvuk). Neka dijete uživa u otkrivanju zvukova i uspostavljanju veze između zvuka i predmeta koji ga proizvodi tako što ćete ga imenovati. Na taj način jezik se povezuje s pojmovima, a rječnik se obogaćuje. </p><p>Ovu aktivnost možete praktikovati gotovo u svakoj životnoj situaciji – u igri i tokom slobodnog vremena, ali i tokom svakodnevnih aktivnosti - oblačenja, pripreme obroka, rutinskog održavanja higijene, kupovine, šetnje, vožnje - a ako lokalni zdravstveni propisi to dozvoljavaju, i dok čekate autobus ili svoj red u banci, pošti ili kod ljekara.</p><p><b>Što dijete uči: </b>Vaše dijete uživa u zajedničkim aktivnostima s Vama.

Opisana aktivnost izgrađuje vokabular djeteta i njegovo znanje o svijetu. Omogućite djetetu da istraži svoje okruženje i saopšti Vam što čuje, čak i ako samo brblja ili koristi najjednostavnije riječi.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

Sve što treba da uradite je da uspostavite naviku zastajkivanja i dobrog osluškivanja kako biste uhvatili sve zvukove u sobi ili oko sebe. Budite tihi za trenutak i podstaknite svoje dete da učini isto. Recite nešto poput „Šššššš, hajde da čujemo koji zvuk možemo uhvatiti“, a zatim pokažite na svoje uši. Možete čuti udaranje, cviljenje, škripanje, zveckanje, grebanje, čavrljanje. Ohrabrite dete „Hajde da nabrojimo sve zvuke koje čujemo. Čujem kako otkucava sat, autobus prolazi, komšija dolazi liftom.“ Koristite puno zanimljivih reči, čak i ako ih vaše dete još ne razume.</p><p>Ako je dete starije, pitajte: „Gde da pronađem ovaj zvuk?“ (onda oponašajte traženi zvuk). Neka dete uživa u otkrivanju i uspostavljanju veze između zvuka i predmeta koji ga proizvodi i neka ga imenuje. Na taj način jezik se povezuje s pojmovima a rečnik se bogati.</p><p>Ovu aktivnost možete praktikovati u skoro svakoj životnoj situaciji - tokom slobodne igre i slobodnog vremena, ali i tokom svakodnevnih rutina - oblačenja, pripreme obroka, rutinskog održavanja higijene, kupovine, šetnje, vožnje i (ako lokalni zdravstveni propisi to dozvoljavaju) čekanja na autobus, u redu u banci, pošti ili kod doktora.</p><p><strong>Šta vaše dete uči: </strong>Vaše dete raduje se aktivnostima s vama i dok se igrate imitiraće izraze lica, gestove i kretnje, upirući kažiprstom u ono što ga interesuje i nudeći stvari drugim ljudima kako bi ih zainteresovalo i uključilo u igru. Pomenuta aktivnost izgrađuje vokabular deteta i njegovo znanje o svetu. Omogućite svom detetu da istraži svoje okruženje i saopšti vam šta čuje, čak i ako samo brblja ili koristi jednostavne reči.</p>",

В этот момент можно указать пальцем на свои уши.

Помогайте ему, задавая наводящие вопросы, например: «Смотри, сколько фруктов. Что нам купить?». Если ваш малыш что-то произносит в ответ, повторите его слова, дополните и обратитесь к продавцу.

Если новый человек проявляет излишнее внимание и дружелюбие по отношению к вашему ребёнку, просто скажите: «Давайте дадим ему/ей немного времени, чтобы он/она мог/ла познакомиться с вами», этим вы избежите навешивания на своего ребенка ярлыка застенчивого или боязливого ребенка. В зависимости от ситуации вы можете дать новому человеку небольшую игрушку или другой предмет, с помощью которого вашему ребенку, возможно, станет интересно сделать первый шаг.</p><p><b>Чему учится ваш ребенок: </b>Беспокойство при виде новых людей может длиться довольно долго, но ваш ребенок узнает две вещи. Во-первых, он/она узнает, что вы являетесь источником утешения и спокойствия в неприятных ситуациях (эмоциональная безопасность). Во-вторых, малыш узнает, что другие люди также могут быть милыми и с ними может быть весело (социальное развитие). Как всегда, ваша поддержка имеет большое значение.</p>",

Помолчите немного и поощряйте ребенка делать то же самое.  Скажите что-нибудь вроде «шшшш, давай послушаем, какой звук мы можем уловить», а затем покажите на свои уши. Вы можете услышать стук, скуление, скрип, дребезжание, царапанье, стук. Поощряйте ребенка «Давайте посмотрим, сможем ли мы собрать звуки, которые мы слышим. Я слышу, как тикают часы, проезжает автобус, сосед поднимается на лифте».  Используйте такие интересные слова, даже если ваш ребенок их еще не понимает.  </p><p>Если ребенок постарше, можно также задать вопрос «Где я могу найти этот звук?». (А потом имитируйте это).  Позвольте ему / ей насладиться ощущением открытия и установления связи между звуком и предметом, который его издает, дав ему имя. Таким образом, язык будет связан с концепциями и также обогатит словарный запас. </p><p>Вы можете использовать это занятие практически в любой жизненной ситуации - во время свободной игры и в свободное время, но также и в повседневных делах - при одевании, приготовлении еды, соблюдении гигиены, покупках, ходьбе, езде за рулем и (если позволяют местные правила здравоохранения) ожидании автобуса или в очереди в банке, на почте или у врача.</p><p><strong>Что изучает ваш ребенок:  </strong>Ваш ребенок с нетерпением ждет занятий с вами, и когда вы вместе играете, он имитирует мимику, жесты и некоторые действия близких людей, указывает указательным пальцем на то, что его / её интересует, или предлагает вещи другим людям, чтобы заинтересовать их и вовлечь их в игру. Эта деятельность расширяет его / ее словарный запас и познание мира. Позвольте ребенку исследовать окрестности и рассказывать вам, что он слышит, даже лепетанием или простыми словами.</p>",
