This activity will help your little one to get started with this skill, which with practice they will master in no time. To start, you only need to lay your little one on his or her back on a soft surface, like your bed. Take one of her legs and cross it in front of the other. Do it again with the other leg. Repeat about three times and on the fourth time, take the leg, cross it in front of the other, put your other hand under his or her back and help him or her roll over until he or she is on a tummy. You can recite the following rhyme while doing the exercises:</p>\n<p>Round and round and you'll change</p>\n<p>What you can see</p>\n<p>Round, round, you will give</p>\n<p>You alone will see!</p>\n<p>Remember that all movements must be delicate and that your little one must already have enough strength in his/her neck to avoid hurting him. Lie him or her back on his or her back and repeat for the other side. Finish the exercise with lots of kisses. Now talk to your little one to get his or her attention. When you do it, you can repeat the rhyme.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Help your little one begin to have the strength and coordinated movements to turn from back to tummy, which will allow him or her to start to have the necessary coordination to move in a few months.</p>\n",

You may hear pounding, whining, creaking, rattling, scratching, chattering. Encourage the child “Let’s see if we can collect the sounds we can hear. I can hear the clock ticking, the bus passing, the neighbor arriving by elevator.”  Use lots of interesting words like that - even if your child doesn't understand them yet.  </p>\n<p>If the child is older, you can also ask the question \"Where could I find this sound?\" (And then imitate it).  Let s/he enjoy the feeling of discovery and making the connection between the sound and the object that makes it, by naming it. In that way, the language will connect with the concepts and enrich the vocabulary as well. </p>\n<p>You can use this activity in practically every life situation - during free play and free time, but also during daily routines - dressing, preparing meals, hygiene routine, shopping,  walking, driving, and (if local health requirements permit) waiting for the bus or for your turn at the bank, post office, or at the doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your child is looking forward to activities with you and as you play together she imitates facial expressions, gestures, and some activities of close people, points with her index finger to what interests her/him, or offers things to other people in order to interest them and involve them in the game.

You may also see your child becoming eager to turn book or magazine pages independently.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>The action of turning pages is a new fine motor skill, using your child’s hands more skilfully. Your child’s thinking is also strengthened as he or she makes connections between what is on the pages and the step of turning to see a new picture.</p>\n",
