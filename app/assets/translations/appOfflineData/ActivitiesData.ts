Let it be a real little \"conversation\" - talk to the baby in a gentle voice, smile at them as you talk; while talking, take short breaks from time to time to give your baby a chance to get involved; at some point, the baby will start making simple noises. Speak in a high or low tone, try whisper and singing. Do this alternately with the baby. Repeat the sounds s/he makes.  </p>\n<p>Place the baby face to face with you - the baby will watch you as you make those sounds. The baby in this position can watch you change your facial expression (big smile, outstretched tongue, wide eyes, raised eyebrows, puffy cheeks, or blowing). Observe the baby and if you notice that some of these expressions scare them, quickly change your facial expression, and after a while try again with a softened facial expression. Remember that every baby is different and reacts in different ways.  In this game, keep an expression for a while to give your baby a chance to try to create a new facial expression by watching and imitating you. Repeat what the baby does. </p>\n<p>Another idea is to show the baby a rag doll, or just put a small sock on your finger. Say the baby's name as you move the doll or sock up and down like a puppet. Make sure the baby is following that movement. Then move your finger around. Every time you see your baby following the doll's movements, try a new movement. </p>\n<p>These are very convenient routines while changing diapers, but also can be used in any free moment you spend with the baby.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>At this stage, the best toy - that fascinates the baby the most - is you! Your face, your voice, your hands, your body. Your baby learns to communicate with you and observes people's faces carefully and in detail, maintains long eye contact.</p>\n",

Allow your baby to see you hiding the object under a blanket, diaper, or pillow. If the baby does not start to discover the hidden object, next time cover it partially. Help the baby find the item.</p>\n<p>Loosely wrap a small toy in a paper towel or tissue (do not use tape). The child can unroll the package and find a surprise. You can also use some other soft paper or wrapping paper with cheerful colors that rustle. You can also wrap the toy in a thin napkin, cloth, or diaper. Another idea is to make a surprise bag that the child will find in the morning. Fill a paper bag or canvas bag with the following items or other similar items that you may have: a stuffed toy, something that makes a sound, a small plastic jar with a screw cap, or a book with cardboard pages. Encourage your baby to explore the \"magic bag\".  Make sure items are safe and supervise well.</p>\n<p>Another idea is to play \"pretend games\" with a stuffed toy or a doll. Show and tell the child what the doll is doing (walking, going to sleep, eating, playing at the table). Use words to describe what the doll is doing, maybe give the doll a voice - anything that is fun for you and your child.  Give the child that toy and see if he will move the doll and do what you do.  You can take turns if your child enjoys that game!</p>\n<p>Children like to play with objects that produce sounds and make noise. If you have time and have the materials, you could make a more complex rattle by stringing metal bracelets wide enough to fit over the baby's hand.  You could also fill small plastic bottles (with lids that children cannot open) with objects that sound different, e.g. marbles, rice, salt, grains of corn, etc.  If you do this, be sure to close the lids tightly for safety, and encourage the child to explore the sounds.</p>\n<p>You can use this activity when you have some free time, use it for simple play with your child.  If there are older siblings, encourage them to play in a similar manner with the youngest member of the family.  </p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong> your child starts to discover new objects or persons by touching and playing with them. These activities help to develop their fine motor and sensory skills.</p>\n",

            "body": "<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A floor mat or blanket, favorite toys, rattles.  </p>\n<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Position the baby so that you can touch his/her feet. Gently play with his/her feet and toes and gently tickle him/her. Touch the baby's finger one by one and at the same time say, \"This finger is… little thumb/mom's finger/dad's finger\" for each finger. While the baby is on her/his back, place a wind-up toy that produces sound (if you have one) next to or behind the baby. Check if the baby is looking for the source of the sound.  Or gently shake a rattle or jar with beans and see if the baby looks for it.</p>\n<p>On a soft flat surface, on the bed or blanket, while lying on her back, gently tap or massage the baby's hands and fingers as you talk with her - for example, \"Here is your hand; here are your fingers,\" telling her what you are doing. Or you could sing a gentle song as you stroke her hands.  Another idea is to use a simple toy that you place where the baby can see it, but where she cannot reach it.  Does she try?  You might move the toy as the baby looks at it.  As the baby gets older, you could encourage your baby to roll over to reach for the toy.</p>\n<p>There are so many ideas for \"floor time\" as your baby grows!  Place a blanket or a towel on the carpet, put the baby on his/her tummy so that his/her head is turned to one side. Lie next to the baby to encourage him/her. The baby can stay in this position as long as s/he likes it, but make sure that his/her head is turned to the left and the right side for about the same length of time. Again, you can put favorite toys or objects in front of the baby, but so that they are just a little out of the baby's reach. As your baby gets older, encourage your baby to try to reach them and move in their direction.</p>\n<p>\"Tummy time\" is important for physical development.  Make sure the time your baby spends on his/her tummy is a little longer each day. Observe your baby, so you can gently move the baby if s/he turns his face directly to the floor, as this can make breathing difficult. As s/he gets stronger over time, the baby will be able to raise her head and rise a little by pushing with her hands.  These motions will later grow into rolling and crawling.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>These are excellent opportunities to use simple games to create a positive, enjoyable environment for your child. During these games, your child learns to explore and control the movements of his/her body and head. A baby may be able to raise her head and support herself with her arms.  </p>\n",

This encourages maintaining balance while walking. To encourage the child to take the first steps, when he/she is in a standing position and facing another person, encourage him/her to step towards that other person who is calling him/her holding a favourite toy or other objects (sometimes the person himself is a sufficient motive).</p>\n<p>Children enjoy toys that are pushed and pulled. If you don't already have one, make a simple toy that is pulled by passing a piece of wool or a thicker knitting thread or a soft rope (about 60 cm long) through a box or a thread spool. Tie a ball or a plastic string at the other end to serve as a handle. </p>\n<p>A large box can be a great place to sit and play. Children love to use large packaging as new small spaces in which they can fit and enjoy. Encourage the child to enter, get out of the box, or to sit in it... Make a bridge or a tunnel out of the box so that he/she can pass through it to the other side, where you or your favourite toy are waiting for him/her.<br />\nCreate terrain with some obstacles in the room with the help of boxes, small mats, pillows or pieces of soft furniture so that the child can move to overcome those obstacles, to roll over or to cross them, go under and through them.</p>\n<p>The child learns that different toys \"do\" different things. Let him/her play with a variety of things that he/she can roll, push, pull, hug, shake, press, turn, stack, spin and mix. Most children enjoy listening to music. Encourage the child to move forward, around and backwards with the music, because that is how he exercises balance. If necessary, help him by holding his hands.  All of this supports his/her new walking skills.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>This activity helps your child learn to move independently in different directions, at different speeds or combine different movements (to stop moving and wave). He/she is so motivated to master this skill that he/she will expect you to dedicate every free moment of your life to support him/her in mastering this so important life function.  Please do create the environment he/she is looking for!</p>\n",

In that way, the language will connect with the concepts and enrich the vocabulary as well. </p>\n<p>You can use this activity in practically every life situation - during free play and free time, but also during daily routines - dressing, preparing meals, hygiene routine, shopping,  walking, driving, and (if local health requirements permit) waiting for the bus or for your turn at the bank, post office, or at the doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your child is looking forward to activities with you and as you play together she imitates facial expressions, gestures, and some activities of close people, points with her index finger to what interests her/him, or offers things to other people in order to interest them and involve them in the game. This activity builds his/her vocabulary and knowledge of the world. Let your child explore the surroundings and tell you what s/he hears, even with babbling or simple words.</p>\n",

If your child has been doing this before, you’ll probably see your child quickly do this.</p>\n<p>Let your child have time to use the materials any way she or he wishes.  You can say things like “Oh, look how you have made so many marks with that pencil.  I see a big circle here, and a long, long line there!” If possible, you might tape up a few of your child’s “scribble drawings” where you and the family can admire them later.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>These experiences are beginning steps toward drawing and writing. Your child is gaining more control of the small muscles in her fingers and hands.  Your child is also beginning to make connections between what her brain is thinking (make a long, long mark) and what her fingers are doing.  Also, you are stimulating her language development when you use words to describe what your child is doing. </p>\n",

You do not need to teach your child this. Instead, give your child many opportunities to use his or her hands in many ways. One game is just to put some small objects (anything that is safe) on the floor with a basket or small box. With you nearby for safety (because children put small objects in their mouths), encourage your child to put objects in the container and take them out.  You can do it too, saying things like “Here goes another block into the box.

Or maybe they’d enjoy drawing and labeling the animals and insects they discover? Another fun option would be to introduce a memory game – challenge them to learn a list of the different animals/insects/plants/birds they spot and see if they repeat it out loud.

Which ones can they use to crawl under, jump over or go through? Which ones can be used to balance on their head as they spin around? Once they’ve designed their course and tried it out, they can have fun introducing different rules and variations.</p>\n<p>Cardboard boxes and swimming floats are the best items to start with, but also think about how you could use stuffed toys, hula hoops, balls or even a blanket. Put everything in the center of the outdoor space. Build different obstacles in a large circle around you. Consider making one obstacle that you need to climb over, one you need to jump over, one you need to go under and one you need to go through. When you are finished, test your course! Use a stopwatch to time yourself and try to keep beating your best time.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Building an obstacle course outside is a fun way for your child to get creative, active and, well, maybe a bit messy, too! All they need are household items that are light, easy and safe to move around – such as cardboard boxes and cushions. This playtime will feed their imagination, challenge their cognitive skills and get their muscles moving as they climb, run and crawl around the course.</p>\n",

Allow them to explore them a bit, then encourage them to sort the items in different ways.  With younger children, you might just say \"Let's put some of them together.  Which ones would you like to put together?\"  and then comment, for example, \"Oh, I see you put some big leaves together.  Shall we put the small ones together also?\"   Older children might be encouraged to sort according to different criteria. For example, by putting \"Green paper clips on one side and red on the other\". Praise your child when s/he tries and talk as much as possible while the activity is taking place “Ah, you took the red one. You put it with other reds”. Resist the urge to fix what the child does - it is not at this age a \"mistake.\"  Instead, just describe what the child is doing - for example: “Oh, a yellow one with red ones”.

I need a big one. See those pans?  Can you find a really big one?” You know your child’s language skills best.  Make your conversation fun, not a test, but a way to use interesting, maybe new words in an activity he/she will love to do with you.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This kind of activity, with lots of talking together with doing interesting things, will strengthen vocabulary and general language development. Your child will expand her/his understanding of more complex words and phrases and will gradually begin to use these her- or himself. Be sure to continue to look at and read books together and to tell stories. Talking with your child during these times is also an important way to build her/his language and communication skills.</p>\n",

If your child is eager to talk, call a special family member or friend and get started by saying something like “Kama wants to tell you about what happened at school today.  Kama, can you tell Grandma what happened first?”  (you might need to prompt, “Want to tell about the bus ride?”) Then encourage your child to continue as much as he or she wants, asking some questions or making suggestions about what to tell.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to vary this. For example, your child might like to draw a picture about what happened and show or send it to family or a friend. Many other events can be made into stories for your child to tell. Remember that children differ in how comfortable they are in telling events to other people, so you might start with yourself. Another variation is to have your child tell her or his story into your phone’s recorder (if you have one). He or she will love hearing it played back.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child’s skills in communication, planning, and reasoning are all involved in her or his logical thinking about what to tell, and in what sequence. And of course, keeping connected with family strengthens your child’s social and emotional well-being. Keep up the conversations! </p>\n",
