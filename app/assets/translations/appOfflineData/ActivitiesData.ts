Let it be a real little \"conversation\" - talk to the baby in a gentle voice, smile at them as you talk; while talking, take short breaks from time to time to give your baby a chance to get involved; at some point, the baby will start making simple noises. Speak in a high or low tone, try whisper and singing. Do this alternately with the baby. Repeat the sounds s/he makes.  </p>\n<p>Place the baby face to face with you - the baby will watch you as you make those sounds. The baby in this position can watch you change your facial expression (big smile, outstretched tongue, wide eyes, raised eyebrows, puffy cheeks, or blowing). Observe the baby and if you notice that some of these expressions scare them, quickly change your facial expression, and after a while try again with a softened facial expression. Remember that every baby is different and reacts in different ways.  In this game, keep an expression for a while to give your baby a chance to try to create a new facial expression by watching and imitating you. Repeat what the baby does. </p>\n<p>Another idea is to show the baby a rag doll, or just put a small sock on your finger. Say the baby's name as you move the doll or sock up and down like a puppet. Make sure the baby is following that movement. Then move your finger around. Every time you see your baby following the doll's movements, try a new movement. </p>\n<p>These are very convenient routines while changing diapers, but also can be used in any free moment you spend with the baby.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>At this stage, the best toy - that fascinates the baby the most - is you! Your face, your voice, your hands, your body. Your baby learns to communicate with you and observes people's faces carefully and in detail, maintains long eye contact.</p>\n",

Allow your baby to see you hiding the object under a blanket, diaper, or pillow. If the baby does not start to discover the hidden object, next time cover it partially. Help the baby find the item.</p>\n<p>Loosely wrap a small toy in a paper towel or tissue (do not use tape). The child can unroll the package and find a surprise. You can also use some other soft paper or wrapping paper with cheerful colors that rustle. You can also wrap the toy in a thin napkin, cloth, or diaper. Another idea is to make a surprise bag that the child will find in the morning. Fill a paper bag or canvas bag with the following items or other similar items that you may have: a stuffed toy, something that makes a sound, a small plastic jar with a screw cap, or a book with cardboard pages. Encourage your baby to explore the \"magic bag\".  Make sure items are safe and supervise well.</p>\n<p>Another idea is to play \"pretend games\" with a stuffed toy or a doll. Show and tell the child what the doll is doing (walking, going to sleep, eating, playing at the table). Use words to describe what the doll is doing, maybe give the doll a voice - anything that is fun for you and your child.  Give the child that toy and see if he will move the doll and do what you do.  You can take turns if your child enjoys that game!</p>\n<p>Children like to play with objects that produce sounds and make noise. If you have time and have the materials, you could make a more complex rattle by stringing metal bracelets wide enough to fit over the baby's hand.  You could also fill small plastic bottles (with lids that children cannot open) with objects that sound different, e.g. marbles, rice, salt, grains of corn, etc.  If you do this, be sure to close the lids tightly for safety, and encourage the child to explore the sounds.</p>\n<p>You can use this activity when you have some free time, use it for simple play with your child.  If there are older siblings, encourage them to play in a similar manner with the youngest member of the family.  </p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong> your child starts to discover new objects or persons by touching and playing with them. These activities help to develop their fine motor and sensory skills.</p>\n",

            "body": "<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A floor mat or blanket, favorite toys, rattles.  </p>\n<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Position the baby so that you can touch his/her feet. Gently play with his/her feet and toes and gently tickle him/her. Touch the baby's finger one by one and at the same time say, \"This finger is… little thumb/mom's finger/dad's finger\" for each finger. While the baby is on her/his back, place a wind-up toy that produces sound (if you have one) next to or behind the baby. Check if the baby is looking for the source of the sound.  Or gently shake a rattle or jar with beans and see if the baby looks for it.</p>\n<p>On a soft flat surface, on the bed or blanket, while lying on her back, gently tap or massage the baby's hands and fingers as you talk with her - for example, \"Here is your hand; here are your fingers,\" telling her what you are doing. Or you could sing a gentle song as you stroke her hands.  Another idea is to use a simple toy that you place where the baby can see it, but where she cannot reach it.  Does she try?  You might move the toy as the baby looks at it.  As the baby gets older, you could encourage your baby to roll over to reach for the toy.</p>\n<p>There are so many ideas for \"floor time\" as your baby grows!  Place a blanket or a towel on the carpet, put the baby on his/her tummy so that his/her head is turned to one side. Lie next to the baby to encourage him/her. The baby can stay in this position as long as s/he likes it, but make sure that his/her head is turned to the left and the right side for about the same length of time. Again, you can put favorite toys or objects in front of the baby, but so that they are just a little out of the baby's reach. As your baby gets older, encourage your baby to try to reach them and move in their direction.</p>\n<p>\"Tummy time\" is important for physical development.  Make sure the time your baby spends on his/her tummy is a little longer each day. Observe your baby, so you can gently move the baby if s/he turns his face directly to the floor, as this can make breathing difficult. As s/he gets stronger over time, the baby will be able to raise her head and rise a little by pushing with her hands.  These motions will later grow into rolling and crawling.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>These are excellent opportunities to use simple games to create a positive, enjoyable environment for your child. During these games, your child learns to explore and control the movements of his/her body and head. A baby may be able to raise her head and support herself with her arms.  </p>\n",

Let it be a real little \"conversation\" - talk to the baby in a gentle voice, smile at them as you talk; while talking, take short breaks from time to time to give your baby a chance to get involved; at some point, the baby will start making simple noises. Speak in a high or low tone, try whisper and singing. Do this alternately with the baby. Repeat the sounds s/he makes.  </p>\n<p>Place the baby face to face with you - the baby will watch you as you make those sounds. The baby in this position can watch you change your facial expression (big smile, outstretched tongue, wide eyes, raised eyebrows, puffy cheeks, or blowing). Observe the baby and if you notice that some of these expressions scare them, quickly change your facial expression, and after a while try again with a softened facial expression. Remember that every baby is different and reacts in different ways.  In this game, keep an expression for a while to give your baby a chance to try to create a new facial expression by watching and imitating you. Repeat what the baby does. </p>\n<p>Another idea is to show the baby a rag doll, or just put a small sock on your finger. Say the baby's name as you move the doll or sock up and down like a puppet. Make sure the baby is following that movement. Then move your finger around. Every time you see your baby following the doll's movements, try a new movement. </p>\n<p>These are very convenient routines while changing diapers, but also can be used in any free moment you spend with the baby.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>At this stage, the best toy - that fascinates the baby the most - is you! Your face, your voice, your hands, your body. Your baby learns to communicate with you and observes people's faces carefully and in detail, maintains long eye contact.</p>\n",

Allow your baby to see you hiding the object under a blanket, diaper, or pillow. If the baby does not start to discover the hidden object, next time cover it partially. Help the baby find the item.</p>\n<p>Loosely wrap a small toy in a paper towel or tissue (do not use tape). The child can unroll the package and find a surprise. You can also use some other soft paper or wrapping paper with cheerful colors that rustle. You can also wrap the toy in a thin napkin, cloth, or diaper. Another idea is to make a surprise bag that the child will find in the morning. Fill a paper bag or canvas bag with the following items or other similar items that you may have: a stuffed toy, something that makes a sound, a small plastic jar with a screw cap, or a book with cardboard pages. Encourage your baby to explore the \"magic bag\".  Make sure items are safe and supervise well.</p>\n<p>Another idea is to play \"pretend games\" with a stuffed toy or a doll. Show and tell the child what the doll is doing (walking, going to sleep, eating, playing at the table). Use words to describe what the doll is doing, maybe give the doll a voice - anything that is fun for you and your child.  Give the child that toy and see if he will move the doll and do what you do.  You can take turns if your child enjoys that game!</p>\n<p>Children like to play with objects that produce sounds and make noise. If you have time and have the materials, you could make a more complex rattle by stringing metal bracelets wide enough to fit over the baby's hand.  You could also fill small plastic bottles (with lids that children cannot open) with objects that sound different, e.g. marbles, rice, salt, grains of corn, etc.  If you do this, be sure to close the lids tightly for safety, and encourage the child to explore the sounds.</p>\n<p>You can use this activity when you have some free time, use it for simple play with your child.  If there are older siblings, encourage them to play in a similar manner with the youngest member of the family.  </p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong> your child starts to discover new objects or persons by touching and playing with them. These activities help to develop their fine motor and sensory skills.</p>\n",

            "body": "<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A floor mat or blanket, favorite toys, rattles.  </p>\n<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Position the baby so that you can touch his/her feet. Gently play with his/her feet and toes and gently tickle him/her. Touch the baby's finger one by one and at the same time say, \"This finger is… little thumb/mom's finger/dad's finger\" for each finger. While the baby is on her/his back, place a wind-up toy that produces sound (if you have one) next to or behind the baby. Check if the baby is looking for the source of the sound.  Or gently shake a rattle or jar with beans and see if the baby looks for it.</p>\n<p>On a soft flat surface, on the bed or blanket, while lying on her back, gently tap or massage the baby's hands and fingers as you talk with her - for example, \"Here is your hand; here are your fingers,\" telling her what you are doing. Or you could sing a gentle song as you stroke her hands.  Another idea is to use a simple toy that you place where the baby can see it, but where she cannot reach it.  Does she try?  You might move the toy as the baby looks at it.  As the baby gets older, you could encourage your baby to roll over to reach for the toy.</p>\n<p>There are so many ideas for \"floor time\" as your baby grows!  Place a blanket or a towel on the carpet, put the baby on his/her tummy so that his/her head is turned to one side. Lie next to the baby to encourage him/her. The baby can stay in this position as long as s/he likes it, but make sure that his/her head is turned to the left and the right side for about the same length of time. Again, you can put favorite toys or objects in front of the baby, but so that they are just a little out of the baby's reach. As your baby gets older, encourage your baby to try to reach them and move in their direction.</p>\n<p>\"Tummy time\" is important for physical development.  Make sure the time your baby spends on his/her tummy is a little longer each day. Observe your baby, so you can gently move the baby if s/he turns his face directly to the floor, as this can make breathing difficult. As s/he gets stronger over time, the baby will be able to raise her head and rise a little by pushing with her hands.  These motions will later grow into rolling and crawling.</p>\n<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>These are excellent opportunities to use simple games to create a positive, enjoyable environment for your child. During these games, your child learns to explore and control the movements of his/her body and head. A baby may be able to raise her head and support herself with her arms.  </p>\n",
