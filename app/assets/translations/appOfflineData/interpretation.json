It has been proven and scientifically confirmed that breastfeeding, especially prolonged - at least 12 months, protects a child from obesity later in childhood and adulthood. For babies on artificial nutrition, there is always a danger of overweight.  For overweight or obese babies, advice from the baby's doctor can be helpful. Never withhold food from a baby in an attempt to cause weight loss. To grow and develop as they should, babies need proper nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months of life. For formula-fed babies, make sure you follow the instructions to prepare the feeds correctly (right amount of water and powder) and follow the instruction for the number of the feeds and the amount of feeds per day.</p>\n"
