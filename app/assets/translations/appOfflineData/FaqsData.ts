If you can, try to spend some time with the other caregiver and your child together so that you can observe how they interact.</p>",

You can make your children more settled by reassuring them that you will come back to pick them up. For older children, try to give a specific moment, for example, “after your dinner” or “when it gets dark outside”.</p>",

You can help people in your family understand the specific disability your children have, including their strengths and their challenges. </p>",

At home, you do not need to give your children lessons.  Parents do not have to be “teachers.” </p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>Just watch what they like to do and share their interest when you have time.  For example, perhaps they are interested in cars and trucks.  You can watch them as they pass in the road.  You can talk about the different kinds of cars, count them, tell stories about where the trucks may be going and what they may carry.  When you show your child that you are interested and when you encourage your child’s learning, you are giving your child the most important gifts you have!</p>",

            "answer_part_2": "<p>When they carefully pile them up, they are learning about balance.  They notice the shapes and number of the blocks.  Perhaps they creatively pretend that the blocks are small people walking in a row.  This is just one small example of learning through play. </p>",

Perhaps you have simple books in your home language.  You can read these to your children or tell them stories in your home language. </p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>Even though their school will teach a different language, with your help, they are learning about what books and stories are about, how to tell a story, how to ask and answer questions, and so on. As your children begin school, if you have a good foundation in your home language and culture, they will not find it challenging to learn the new language later on. </p>",

For example, your home has many small objects (eating utensils, socks, leaves from your garden) that your child can use for counting, organizing objects into groups (put the forks together and the spoons together), using language to describe (which is the biggest leaf, the most beautiful, the red one, etc.).</p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>Your children can also learn without materials, just by participating in what your family does. Perhaps they can prepare food with you, or help in the garden, or shop with their father at the market.

In some countries, television programs have been developed for preschool-age children. If your child enjoys these, they can be part of your child’s learning experiences.</p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>However, avoid just putting your children in front of a screen for hours at a time. Aim for a maximum of one hour per day in front of the screen (watching, playing games etc.) They need to play with real objects, explore their home and community environment, be physically active, and spend time with other children when possible.

Your children listen because they will get something, not because they understand why they need to behave (the rule or limit).

Oh, wonderful, now Maria can have a turn. Good sharing! Maria, when you have had a turn, please give the car to Andres when you feel ready.”</p>",

If that is the problem, you can slip a finger in, press, and firmly say, “no biting! that hurts mama!” Your baby does not know that it hurts. Somewhat older children, age 1 or 2, may bite another child if frustrated about something. Again, it is important to firmly stop the behaviour while saying, “No! Biting hurts!”</p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>You can then tell the children what you would like them to do in the future. Comforting the child who is bitten is also important. Usually, older preschool children do not bite others. If your child is very easily frustrated and has other behaviour or developmental challenges (such as avoiding social connections or being unable to use language at age 3-5), do talk with your health provider about your concerns.</p>",

Sometimes saying NO is part of your child’s developing an independent identity. Try not to give too much attention to the “no-saying” of your child. The more attention you give, the more your child will say “no”. Praise the child a lot when the child is doing something good: “You tried your best, well done!”</p>",

It is important to communicate to your child that ALL feelings are OK. It’s OK to feel angry, to feel sad or frustrated. You can then name the sentiment: “I can see you are frustrated because you can’t reach your toy” or “I can see that you’re feeling angry about turning off the TV.” After naming the feeling, you pause for a few seconds. This pause might be enough for the child to calm down and move on to something else. Or he may then start crying or throwing a tantrum, that is fine.</p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>Emotions and stress need to be released in one way or another as they will pile up and may come out as negative behaviour later (like hitting). Once your child has calmed down, it is important to talk about the bad behaviour. Because it has to be clear to your child that all emotions are OK, but not all behaviour, then describe the behaviour that you want in the future. This is very important; otherwise, your child will still not know what to do and will keep on misbehaving.

            "answer_part_2": "<p>For example, if your children have difficulty using their hands skillfully, you can play games with simple objects that you pick up, give to your children, and they give back. If language is slow to develop, you will find extra times to talk with your child and to warmly encourage him to use sounds. These can happen any time - it is not a “lesson” but making the most of everyday activities.</p>",

They learn physical skills (climb, roll, throw and catch) but also about science (like plants and birds outdoors). Children who play outdoors regularly are often more curious, come up with more new activities and are likely to stay with a task longer.</p>",

Severe and life-threatening allergies to vaccine ingredients are one of these few contraindications.  Very often, certain conditions are commonly misperceived as contraindications. Some contraindications are temporary and the vaccines can be administered as soon as the condition, such as high-grade fever, disappears.</p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>Contraindications also depend on the vaccine. For example, the MMR vaccine, which has attenuated (weakened) viruses, may not be administered to severely immunocompromised persons. If you are concerned that a vaccine may be contraindicated to your child, discuss it with your child’s doctor. Remember that vaccines prevent dangerous diseases. By vaccinating your child, you help them grow healthy and thrive.</p>",

You can often treat these events at home, with an over-the-counter pain medication.</p>",

            "answer_part_2": "<p>By stimulating the immune system through the production of antibodies, vaccines prepare our bodies to recognize and combat specific viruses or bacteria before they can make us sick.

If, in the future, you get in contact with a very similar, but live and strong germ, through a real infection, your immune system will remember how to quickly destroy it before you become unwell. The vaccine is therefore a safe and the best way to produce an immune response in the body without causing an illness.</p>",

When a large number of people in a community are vaccinated, disease transmission becomes very unlikely, creating herd/community immunity.</p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>For example, for measles, herd immunity occurs when the vast majority – around 95% - of a community is vaccinated. Thanks to herd immunity, we protect even those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g some vaccines are contraindicated for pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems). However, when herd/community immunity is achieved, it does not mean that unvaccinated people who have not been previously infected are immune. Instead, herd immunity exists when individuals who are not immune have a reduced risk of disease compared to non-immune individuals living in a community that has not achieved herd immunity. For their own benefit and the benefit of the whole community, all eligible individuals should choose to get vaccinated.</p>",

Corrected age can be helpful if you are trying to work out whether your premature baby’s development is tracking in a typical way. </p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>For example, if someone notices that your child is six months old but not sitting up yet, you could explain that she was born three months early. If you look at her corrected age, she is really only three months old and she is doing everything a three-month-old usually does. Corrected age is especially relevant during your child’s early years, because it might explain things that look like lags in development in these years. If you are giving your child a first birthday party, you should celebrate his birthday one year from when he was born, regardless of corrected age!</p>",

When situations are extreme (such as nights without sleep, having a small baby at home for the first time, cramps and or constant crying, dangerous situations as pandemia, flooding, etc.), anxiety may trigger a fight-or-flight physiological reaction. </p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>If we, hopefully, choose to stay, we need to fight – to get more knowledge, to call a lover or a friend for support. Ideally, we only decide to run away from threats when distance and haste promise safety, as in the case of an avalanche, fire or physical danger. Sometimes people feel anxiety when there is no real threat but when something is triggered internally. This will not always interfere with a person’s ability to function. Still, if the symptoms include prolonged sweating, increased heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, overwhelming sense of uneasiness, constant worrying, there may be underlying anxiety disorders that need attention.</p>",

This shows that they’re developing well--recognizing familiar and not-familiar people. Preschool children sometimes worry about monsters or scary films. Talk to your child about her worries without making fun of her for her fears. Also be sure to limit the time and type of videos your child watches.</p>",

Crucially, feeding responsively recognises that feeds are not just for nutrition, but also for love, comfort and reassurance between baby and mother. For example, when a mother breastfeeds her baby responsively, she may offer her breast when her baby shows signs of hunger or when her baby is distressed, fractious, or appears lonely.</p>",
            "answer_part_2": "<p>Breastfeeding can help settle her baby after an immunisation, if her baby is unwell or to reassure him or her in an unfamiliar environment. The key to understanding responsive feeding is that it is what ultimately makes both breastfeeding and early parenting easier. Feeding becomes the first and usually most successful action when responding to a baby’s needs. It is important that mothers are aware that their baby cannot be overfed or ‘spoiled’ by ‘too much feeding’ and that breastfeeding will not, in and of itself, tire a mother any more than the normal tiredness that all mothers have when caring for their newborn baby.</p>",

If you are breastfeeding, continue to breastfeed - start feeding with the sore breast first. Express milk from your breast in between feeds and massage your breast to clear any blockages – stroke from the sore area towards your nipple to help the milk flow. Also, rest and drink lots of fluids.</p>",
