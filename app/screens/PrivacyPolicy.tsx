  const body = "<p><strong>Halo Beba/Parentbuddy Application Privacy Policy</strong></p>\n\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the HaloBeba/Parentbuddy application (hereinafter: The Application), a parenting application, that serves to provide information and guidance to parents of young children, 0-6 years old. It sets out how we collect, use and store your information and what steps we take to protect your information. </p>\n\n<p>Taking care of the information you provide is important for UNICEF (United Nations Children s Fund). </p>\n\n<p>Please read our Privacy Policy carefully before using the Application and refer to it regularly to check for updates. By accessing and using the Application, you agree to all provisions in this Privacy Policy. </p>\n\n<p>The Application is not storing any personally identifiable information on any external server automatically, except your email and name once you logged in using that method of registration.</p>\n\n<p>The Application is collecting anonymous data that will be used for analytics and to improve services we are offering to users. The application asks the user to agree about anonymous data collection. This is not mandatory.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>What information do we collect through the Application?</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p>We obtain data  from various sources described below: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Anonymous data that we collect automatically from your use of the application</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you use the  Application, UNICEF and its third-party service providers may collect impersonal information about you through automated means, such as application logs, to be used only for background analytics and to improve features and services provided through the app. We use this anonymous information to track the overall number of users, the frequency of use of different features and the application content, with an aim to improve the app and provide functions and content that will respond to user interests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration/Account Information </strong></p>\n\n<p>You have to register in the  Application before using its content or functional features.  You can register with your existing Google or Facebook account or by providing certain personally identifiable information such as your e-mail address and name. </p>\n\n<p>In order to present you with the content relevant for your child’s age and gender, the application will ask you to provide data on the date of birth of your child and her/his gender. If you choose to use functional features of the app, helping you to track growth, development, vaccinations, and health check-ups of your child, the app will ask you to enter growth measurements, assess developmental milestones, and enter information if the child received vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>If the user chooses to register using email and password, the Application will store email, password, first name, and last name.</p>\n\n<p>If the user chooses to log in using his social network accounts, no account login information is stored on the server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Information and data storage</strong></p>\n\n<p>The application is not collecting any personally identifiable information except the user’s email and is not storing them on any external server automatically. All data entered into the Application are stored only on the user’s personal device. Users are fully responsible for any data stored on their devices, in line with respective Google and Apple privacy policies.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about Google’s and Apple privacy policies by going to:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy\">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy</a></p>\n\n<p>The application consists of 2 unencrypted databases both located on the user’s personal smart device – Data and User. The Data database contains general application data like information about accessed articles and FAQ, while the User database contains all data about the child that parent entered into the application like checked milestones, vaccinations, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Users can always send requests through the application to delete accounts and all data located on the phone.  All Application data from the phone and CMS is automatically deleted per user request. In case the user registered in the application with email, that data (name and email) will be also deleted from the external server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data backup and synchronization between the parents</strong></p>\n\n<p>A parent can decide to backup all application data or to synchronize data with another parent.</p>\n\n<p>In the case that a user wants to back up the app data (e.g. in case that user wants to restore all data on another smart device) , and only upon action that only user can initiate manually, all textual data will be backed up and stored on user’s personal Google drive.</p>\n\n<p>In case of synchronization with another parent, data will be only temporally stored on user’s Google drive until synchronization got completed. In both cases, while en route to and from Google’s servers, all user’s files are encrypted with a 248-bit SSL/TLS key. Data on the cloud itself is protected with 128-bit AES encryption, in line with highest Google security standards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>User-Generated Content and Communications</strong> </p>\n\n<p> If you contact us directly by sending us mail or writing a comment, or we contact you and you chose to reply, we may receive more information about you.
